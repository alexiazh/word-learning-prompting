A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three purps:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. toucan\n3. pig\n\nNow pick out the other purps from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. car\n3. loader\n4. green bell pepper\n5. box truck\n6. basset hound\n7. cat\n8. carrot\n9. bee\n10. onion\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador\n13. crane\n14. full-trailer truck\n15. school bus\n16. seal\n17. chiller truck\n18. eggplant\n19. Dalmatian\n20. bear\n21. red bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. motorcycle and toucan\n2. bear and toucan\n3. green bell pepper and red bell pepper\n4. loader and seal\n5. pumpkin and bear\n6. green bell pepper and potato\n7. Labrador and yellow bell pepper\n8. cat and bee\n9. carrot and onion\n10. bear and carrot\n11. chiller truck and full-trailer truck\n12. mutt and carrot\n13. garbage truck and potato\n14. school bus and car\n15. mutt and potato\n16. mutt and eggplant\n17. eggplant and terrier\n18. eggplant and yellow bell pepper\n19. garbage truck and carrot\n20. box truck and full-trailer truck\n21. Dalmatian and onion\n22. motorcycle and bear\n23. carrot and school bus\n24. loader and pig\n25. carrot and toucan\n26. loader and carrot\n27. motorcycle and chiller truck\n28. basset hound and carrot\n29. mutt and toucan\n30. Labrador and school bus\n31. box truck and bee\n32. toucan and car\n33. potato and car\n34. box truck and chiller truck\n35. toucan and chiller truck\n36. onion and toucan\n37. cat and eggplant\n38. cat and semi-trailer truck\n39. Dalmatian and semi-trailer truck\n40. box truck and school bus\n41. basset hound and semi-trailer truck\n42. mutt and seal\n43. loader and full-trailer truck\n44. pumpkin and cat\n45. tractor and car\n46. seal and bear\n47. basset hound and bee\n48. pumpkin and eggplant\n49. Dalmatian and red bell pepper\n50. bear and terrier\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
