A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three purps:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. toucan\n3. pig\n\nNow pick out the other purps from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. car\n3. loader\n4. green bell pepper\n5. box truck\n6. basset hound\n7. cat\n8. carrot\n9. bee\n10. onion\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador\n13. crane\n14. full-trailer truck\n15. school bus\n16. seal\n17. chiller truck\n18. eggplant\n19. Dalmatian\n20. bear\n21. red bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. tractor and eggplant\n2. loader and garbage truck\n3. motorcycle and cat\n4. green bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n5. crane and cat\n6. tractor and basset hound\n7. loader and yellow bell pepper\n8. Dalmatian and potato\n9. red bell pepper and potato\n10. carrot and car\n11. Dalmatian and cat\n12. mutt and onion\n13. motorcycle and bee\n14. semi-trailer truck and school bus\n15. loader and terrier\n16. pumpkin and terrier\n17. Labrador and pig\n18. tractor and seal\n19. basset hound and school bus\n20. cat and onion\n21. pig and eggplant\n22. semi-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n23. chiller truck and car\n24. seal and cat\n25. chiller truck and yellow bell pepper\n26. Labrador and motorcycle\n27. garbage truck and bear\n28. Dalmatian and green bell pepper\n29. cat and yellow bell pepper\n30. loader and eggplant\n31. tractor and semi-trailer truck\n32. box truck and seal\n33. tractor and Labrador\n34. garbage truck and basset hound\n35. Labrador and car\n36. crane and carrot\n37. seal and onion\n38. loader and chiller truck\n39. motorcycle and potato\n40. seal and chiller truck\n41. green bell pepper and school bus\n42. green bell pepper and garbage truck\n43. bear and onion\n44. Labrador and red bell pepper\n45. crane and semi-trailer truck\n46. Dalmatian and chiller truck\n47. red bell pepper and seal\n48. loader and Labrador\n49. eggplant and toucan\n50. basset hound and cat\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
