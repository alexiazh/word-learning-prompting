A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a lig:\n1. box truck\n\nNow pick out the other ligs from the following list:\n1. car\n2. full-trailer truck\n3. Labrador\n4. box truck\n5. carrot\n6. bee\n7. green bell pepper\n8. bear\n9. basset hound\n10. red bell pepper\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. cat\n13. pumpkin\n14. onion\n15. loader\n16. school bus\n17. Dalmatian\n18. eggplant\n19. chiller truck\n20. seal\n21. crane\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. motorcycle and bee\n2. bear and motorcycle\n3. seal and cat\n4. seal and chiller truck\n5. cat and basset hound\n6. potato and tractor\n7. pumpkin and chiller truck\n8. cat and pig\n9. green bell pepper and bee\n10. toucan and mutt\n11. pumpkin and Labrador\n12. green bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n13. cat and eggplant\n14. car and eggplant\n15. onion and loader\n16. crane and eggplant\n17. basset hound and carrot\n18. green bell pepper and basset hound\n19. pumpkin and mutt\n20. loader and mutt\n21. car and basset hound\n22. motorcycle and toucan\n23. full-trailer truck and terrier\n24. carrot and yellow bell pepper\n25. bear and yellow bell pepper\n26. school bus and eggplant\n27. cat and yellow bell pepper\n28. green bell pepper and garbage truck\n29. yellow bell pepper and garbage truck\n30. carrot and tractor\n31. basset hound and Dalmatian\n32. pumpkin and potato\n33. onion and red bell pepper\n34. Dalmatian and full-trailer truck\n35. potato and motorcycle\n36. loader and red bell pepper\n37. school bus and loader\n38. pumpkin and toucan\n39. garbage truck and pig\n40. loader and Labrador\n41. crane and box truck\n42. box truck and full-trailer truck\n43. semi-trailer truck and chiller truck\n44. semi-trailer truck and motorcycle\n45. red bell pepper and Labrador\n46. chiller truck and bee\n47. Dalmatian and garbage truck\n48. garbage truck and bee\n49. carrot and eggplant\n50. potato and pig\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
