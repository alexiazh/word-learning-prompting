A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a fep:\n1. green bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other feps from the following list:\n1. crane\n2. red bell pepper\n3. seal\n4. onion\n5. Labrador\n6. chiller truck\n7. yellow bell pepper\n8. pumpkin\n9. box truck\n10. cat\n11. car\n12. basset hound\n13. bear\n14. Dalmatian\n15. green bell pepper\n16. eggplant\n17. bee\n18. full-trailer truck\n19. carrot\n20. loader\n21. school bus\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. seal and box truck\n2. bear and mutt\n3. cat and pig\n4. crane and motorcycle\n5. cat and loader\n6. onion and basset hound\n7. garbage truck and potato\n8. onion and motorcycle\n9. bee and full-trailer truck\n10. box truck and school bus\n11. Dalmatian and bear\n12. green bell pepper and mutt\n13. pig and potato\n14. crane and school bus\n15. eggplant and carrot\n16. pig and terrier\n17. chiller truck and mutt\n18. bee and Labrador\n19. school bus and yellow bell pepper\n20. bee and onion\n21. garbage truck and seal\n22.
