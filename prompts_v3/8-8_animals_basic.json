A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three deeks:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. mutt\n3. terrier\n\nNow pick out the other deeks from the following list:\n1. bear\n2. chiller truck\n3. yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck\n5. basset hound\n6. seal\n7. carrot\n8. car\n9. onion\n10. crane\n11. pumpkin\n12. red bell pepper\n13. school bus\n14. bee\n15. Dalmatian\n16. Labrador\n17. cat\n18. eggplant\n19. loader\n20. box truck\n21. green bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. pig and red bell pepper\n2. pig and loader\n3. pig and bear\n4. Dalmatian and onion\n5. pig and bee\n6. pumpkin and onion\n7. loader and Labrador\n8. terrier and onion\n9. red bell pepper and eggplant\n10. semi-trailer truck and school bus\n11. potato and bear\n12. box truck and seal\n13. basset hound and red bell pepper\n14. pumpkin and eggplant\n15. Dalmatian and chiller truck\n16. cat and car\n17. bear and eggplant\n18. garbage truck and Dalmatian\n19. pumpkin and cat\n20. mutt and potato\n21. crane and bear\n22. Dalmatian and car\n23. mutt and eggplant\n24. pig and yellow bell pepper\n25. yellow bell pepper and cat\n26. yellow bell pepper and pumpkin\n27. terrier and carrot\n28. motorcycle and school bus\n29. green bell pepper and tractor\n30. Dalmatian and carrot\n31. box truck and terrier\n32. basset hound and carrot\n33. box truck and carrot\n34. full-trailer truck and toucan\n35. crane and full-trailer truck\n36. green bell pepper and mutt\n37. terrier and bee\n38. yellow bell pepper and school bus\n39. cat and Labrador\n40. tractor and eggplant\n41. full-trailer truck and carrot\n42. box truck and toucan\n43. seal and pumpkin\n44. pumpkin and basset hound\n45. full-trailer truck and onion\n46. pig and potato\n47. crane and seal\n48. onion and carrot\n49. seal and yellow bell pepper\n50. garbage truck and cat\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
