A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. school bus\n2. pumpkin\n3. bear\n4. cat\n5. Labrador\n6. carrot\n7. green bell pepper\n8. onion\n9. bee\n10. box truck\n11. crane\n12. car\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. Dalmatian\n16. basset hound\n17. seal\n18. eggplant\n19. full-trailer truck\n20. red bell pepper\n21. loader\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. pumpkin and tractor\n2. motorcycle and full-trailer truck\n3. potato and Dalmatian\n4. cat and garbage truck\n5. chiller truck and bear\n6. semi-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n7. yellow bell pepper and pumpkin\n8. eggplant and red bell pepper\n9. potato and motorcycle\n10. seal and school bus\n11. cat and pig\n12. loader and full-trailer truck\n13. seal and full-trailer truck\n14. loader and box truck\n15. semi-trailer truck and motorcycle\n16. yellow bell pepper and bear\n17. potato and cat\n18. full-trailer truck and Labrador\n19. yellow bell pepper and car\n20. cat and tractor\n21. eggplant and motorcycle\n22. seal and pig\n23. bear and Labrador\n24. tractor and full-trailer truck\n25. seal and terrier\n26. carrot and motorcycle\n27. seal and crane\n28. loader and basset hound\n29. bee and loader\n30. mutt and motorcycle\n31. potato and toucan\n32. seal and car\n33. basset hound and box truck\n34. yellow bell pepper and red bell pepper\n35. tractor and red bell pepper\n36. bee and crane\n37. green bell pepper and basset hound\n38. terrier and yellow bell pepper\n39. tractor and box truck\n40. mutt and Dalmatian\n41. loader and carrot\n42. chiller truck and toucan\n43. green bell pepper and terrier\n44. Dalmatian and Labrador\n45. eggplant and onion\n46. carrot and car\n47. crane and red bell pepper\n48. motorcycle and box truck\n49. terrier and potato\n50. green bell pepper and potato\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
