    "prompt_to_run": "You will be given a task consisting of two parts:\n1. A word-learning phase where you will be shown examples of a new word and give a similarity score of the word.\n2. A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a bub:\n1. Dalmatian\n\nNow pick out the other bubs from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. bee\n3. onion\n4. loader\n5. green bell pepper\n6. eggplant\n7. basset hound\n8. Labrador\n9. cat\n10. red bell pepper\n11. box truck\n12. bear\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. school bus\n16. car\n17. seal\n18. pumpkin\n19. crane\n20. Dalmatian\n21. full-trailer truck\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. Dalmatian and school bus\n2. eggplant and garbage truck\n3. toucan and cat\n4. green bell pepper and toucan\n5. chiller truck and eggplant\n6. pumpkin and semi-trailer truck\n7. full-trailer truck and green bell pepper\n8. full-trailer truck and bee\n9. Dalmatian and cat\n10. cat and semi-trailer truck\n11. Dalmatian and eggplant\n12. pig and onion\n13. bee and yellow bell pepper\n14. Dalmatian and potato\n15. green bell pepper and eggplant\n16. pig and pumpkin\n17. green bell pepper and bee\n18. chiller truck and tractor\n19. green bell pepper and carrot\n20. full-trailer truck and mutt\n21. motorcycle and seal\n22. pig and school bus\n23. bee and red bell pepper\n24. full-trailer truck and cat\n25. seal and garbage truck\n26. loader and onion\n27. Labrador and potato\n28. bee and potato\n29. school bus and onion\n30. motorcycle and loader\n31. toucan and onion\n32. pig and Dalmatian\n33. mutt and garbage truck\n34. chiller truck and bear\n35. potato and garbage truck\n36. terrier and semi-trailer truck\n37. chiller truck and mutt\n38. chiller truck and basset hound\n39. crane and semi-trailer truck\n40. toucan and terrier\n41. seal and tractor\n42. car and potato\n43. red bell pepper and bear\n44. mutt and semi-trailer truck\n45. motorcycle and school bus\n46. eggplant and box truck\n47. chiller truck and terrier\n48. crane and mutt\n49. Dalmatian and box truck\n50. school bus and semi-trailer truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
