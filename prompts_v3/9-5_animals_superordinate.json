A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three purps:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. toucan\n3. pig\n\nNow pick out the other purps from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. car\n3. loader\n4. green bell pepper\n5. box truck\n6. basset hound\n7. cat\n8. carrot\n9. bee\n10. onion\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador\n13. crane\n14. full-trailer truck\n15. school bus\n16. seal\n17. chiller truck\n18. eggplant\n19. Dalmatian\n20. bear\n21. red bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. potato and full-trailer truck\n2. crane and yellow bell pepper\n3. crane and red bell pepper\n4. school bus and terrier\n5. Dalmatian and loader\n6. green bell pepper and pumpkin\n7. potato and semi-trailer truck\n8. Dalmatian and basset hound\n9. Labrador and toucan\n10. seal and bee\n11. box truck and bear\n12. school bus and chiller truck\n13. green bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n14. loader and car\n15. potato and onion\n16. crane and bee\n17. cat and potato\n18. green bell pepper and cat\n19. Labrador and terrier\n20. carrot and eggplant\n21. crane and pumpkin\n22. green bell pepper and toucan\n23. garbage truck and eggplant\n24. box truck and tractor\n25. bee and school bus\n26. Labrador and bear\n27. pig and bear\n28. Dalmatian and seal\n29. motorcycle and school bus\n30. eggplant and onion\n31. crane and bear\n32. Dalmatian and eggplant\n33. red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n34. box truck and red bell pepper\n35. tractor and onion\n36. eggplant and school bus\n37. crane and onion\n38. pumpkin and carrot\n39. Dalmatian and bear\n40. Dalmatian and yellow bell pepper\n41. crane and box truck\n42. garbage truck and chiller truck\n43. cat and chiller truck\n44. carrot and chiller truck\n45. mutt and green bell pepper\n46. pig and full-trailer truck\n47. basset hound and bear\n48. pumpkin and potato\n49. school bus and toucan\n50. semi-trailer truck and eggplant\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
