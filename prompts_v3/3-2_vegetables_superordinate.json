A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three shars:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. potato\n3. eggplant\n\nNow pick out the other shars from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. bee\n3. green bell pepper\n4. crane\n5. basset hound\n6. full-trailer truck\n7. Labrador\n8. eggplant\n9. yellow bell pepper\n10. bear\n11. loader\n12. car\n13. box truck\n14. school bus\n15. carrot\n16. red bell pepper\n17. onion\n18. cat\n19. chiller truck\n20. Dalmatian\n21. seal\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. tractor and school bus\n2. motorcycle and semi-trailer truck\n3. mutt and loader\n4. eggplant and yellow bell pepper\n5. tractor and basset hound\n6. Labrador and car\n7. yellow bell pepper and toucan\n8. yellow bell pepper and green bell pepper\n9. semi-trailer truck and box truck\n10. red bell pepper and mutt\n11. semi-trailer truck and crane\n12. motorcycle and seal\n13. Dalmatian and yellow bell pepper\n14. Dalmatian and green bell pepper\n15. garbage truck and onion\n16. pumpkin and loader\n17. basset hound and green bell pepper\n18. basset hound and crane\n19. Dalmatian and mutt\n20. tractor and green bell pepper\n21. eggplant and full-trailer truck\n22. garbage truck and mutt\n23. loader and Labrador\n24. semi-trailer truck and cat\n25. garbage truck and basset hound\n26. onion and box truck\n27. red bell pepper and potato\n28. potato and pig\n29. seal and Dalmatian\n30. pig and carrot\n31. semi-trailer truck and onion\n32. green bell pepper and box truck\n33. eggplant and pig\n34. tractor and terrier\n35. chiller truck and crane\n36. bee and box truck\n37. onion and basset hound\n38. terrier and car\n39. full-trailer truck and loader\n40. chiller truck and car\n41. tractor and red bell pepper\n42. eggplant and terrier\n43. potato and toucan\n44. chiller truck and box truck\n45. green bell pepper and carrot\n46. school bus and cat\n47. cat and crane\n48. loader and cat\n49. garbage truck and eggplant\n50. school bus and car\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
