    "prompt_to_run": "You will be given a task consisting of two parts:\n1. A word-learning phase where you will be shown examples of a new word and give a similarity score of the word.\n2. A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a bub:\n1. Dalmatian\n\nNow pick out the other bubs from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. bee\n3. onion\n4. loader\n5. green bell pepper\n6. eggplant\n7. basset hound\n8. Labrador\n9. cat\n10. red bell pepper\n11. box truck\n12. bear\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. school bus\n16. car\n17. seal\n18. pumpkin\n19. crane\n20. Dalmatian\n21. full-trailer truck\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. basset hound and seal\n2. bee and garbage truck\n3. potato and semi-trailer truck\n4. carrot and loader\n5. tractor and box truck\n6. motorcycle and yellow bell pepper\n7. yellow bell pepper and onion\n8. garbage truck and tractor\n9. bee and crane\n10. Dalmatian and pumpkin\n11. terrier and pumpkin\n12. Dalmatian and crane\n13. toucan and red bell pepper\n14. Labrador and box truck\n15. Labrador and semi-trailer truck\n16. cat and mutt\n17. pumpkin and yellow bell pepper\n18. full-trailer truck and carrot\n19. car and basset hound\n20. full-trailer truck and tractor\n21. loader and mutt\n22. full-trailer truck and bear\n23. pig and box truck\n24. crane and pumpkin\n25. cat and box truck\n26. eggplant and bear\n27. chiller truck and carrot\n28. potato and box truck\n29. eggplant and crane\n30. potato and red bell pepper\n31. bee and pumpkin\n32. cat and pumpkin\n33. Labrador and mutt\n34. basset hound and semi-trailer truck\n35. eggplant and seal\n36. school bus and seal\n37. green bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n38. motorcycle and semi-trailer truck\n39. red bell pepper and crane\n40. car and loader\n41. cat and red bell pepper\n42. bee and school bus\n43. car and bee\n44. pig and toucan\n45. carrot and terrier\n46. Dalmatian and loader\n47. carrot and crane\n48. loader and pumpkin\n49. carrot and school bus\n50. full-trailer truck and loader\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
