A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. school bus\n2. pumpkin\n3. bear\n4. cat\n5. Labrador\n6. carrot\n7. green bell pepper\n8. onion\n9. bee\n10. box truck\n11. crane\n12. car\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. Dalmatian\n16. basset hound\n17. seal\n18. eggplant\n19. full-trailer truck\n20. red bell pepper\n21. loader\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. bee and car\n2. semi-trailer truck and bear\n3. pumpkin and motorcycle\n4. green bell pepper and eggplant\n5. cat and toucan\n6. chiller truck and garbage truck\n7. mutt and carrot\n8. green bell pepper and mutt\n9. semi-trailer truck and red bell pepper\n10. loader and pumpkin\n11. semi-trailer truck and garbage truck\n12. crane and box truck\n13. yellow bell pepper and onion\n14. seal and garbage truck\n15. school bus and box truck\n16. chiller truck and loader\n17. green bell pepper and garbage truck\n18. potato and pumpkin\n19. red bell pepper and Labrador\n20. bee and Labrador\n21. red bell pepper and pig\n22. carrot and full-trailer truck\n23. eggplant and pig\n24. eggplant and bear\n25. seal and eggplant\n26. car and bear\n27. cat and semi-trailer truck\n28. terrier and loader\n29. garbage truck and toucan\n30. bee and semi-trailer truck\n31. crane and pig\n32. tractor and carrot\n33. green bell pepper and seal\n34. potato and onion\n35. pumpkin and carrot\n36. carrot and school bus\n37. tractor and pig\n38. green bell pepper and red bell pepper\n39. Dalmatian and onion\n40. tractor and toucan\n41. cat and red bell pepper\n42. pumpkin and toucan\n43. seal and chiller truck\n44. eggplant and loader\n45. basset hound and full-trailer truck\n46. mutt and tractor\n47. terrier and Labrador\n48. seal and Dalmatian\n49. chiller truck and Labrador\n50. chiller truck and bee\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
