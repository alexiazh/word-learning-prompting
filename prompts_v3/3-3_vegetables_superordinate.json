A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three shars:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. potato\n3. eggplant\n\nNow pick out the other shars from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. bee\n3. green bell pepper\n4. crane\n5. basset hound\n6. full-trailer truck\n7. Labrador\n8. eggplant\n9. yellow bell pepper\n10. bear\n11. loader\n12. car\n13. box truck\n14. school bus\n15. carrot\n16. red bell pepper\n17. onion\n18. cat\n19. chiller truck\n20. Dalmatian\n21. seal\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. motorcycle and cat\n2. pumpkin and bear\n3. terrier and carrot\n4. motorcycle and pig\n5. mutt and yellow bell pepper\n6. bear and yellow bell pepper\n7. onion and crane\n8. chiller truck and yellow bell pepper\n9. onion and bee\n10. loader and chiller truck\n11. eggplant and green bell pepper\n12. tractor and toucan\n13. car and toucan\n14. semi-trailer truck and green bell pepper\n15. red bell pepper and cat\n16. cat and box truck\n17. chiller truck and toucan\n18. bee and carrot\n19. bear and Labrador\n20. tractor and eggplant\n21. pumpkin and red bell pepper\n22. loader and carrot\n23. seal and toucan\n24. pumpkin and green bell pepper\n25. garbage truck and tractor\n26. red bell pepper and bear\n27. yellow bell pepper and car\n28. chiller truck and pig\n29.

Dalmatian and chiller truck\n32. mutt and school bus\n33. bear and basset hound\n34. basset hound and pig\n35. school bus and carrot\n36. pumpkin and yellow bell pepper\n37. garbage truck and Labrador\n38. chiller truck and terrier\n39. tractor and Labrador\n40. eggplant and cat\n41. full-trailer truck and box truck\n42. potato and chiller truck\n43. seal and red bell pepper\n44. loader and crane\n45. red bell pepper and Labrador\n46. Dalmatian and toucan\n47. tractor and bear\n48. potato and basset hound\n49. garbage truck and Dalmatian\n50. garbage truck and cat\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
