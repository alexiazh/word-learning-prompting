A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a fep:\n1. green bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other feps from the following list:\n1. crane\n2. red bell pepper\n3. seal\n4. onion\n5. Labrador\n6. chiller truck\n7. yellow bell pepper\n8. pumpkin\n9. box truck\n10. cat\n11. car\n12. basset hound\n13. bear\n14. Dalmatian\n15. green bell pepper\n16. eggplant\n17. bee\n18. full-trailer truck\n19. carrot\n20. loader\n21. school bus\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. box truck and carrot\n2. cat and toucan\n3. bear and carrot\n4. box truck and chiller truck\n5. terrier and red bell pepper\n6. terrier and motorcycle\n7. seal and carrot\n8. motorcycle and Labrador\n9. loader and chiller truck\n10. cat and full-trailer truck\n11. cat and basset hound\n12. motorcycle and car\n13. Dalmatian and garbage truck\n14. bee and pig\n15. eggplant and pig\n16. cat and yellow bell pepper\n17. basset hound and box truck\n18. mutt and school bus\n19. terrier and box truck\n20. seal and red bell pepper\n21. garbage truck and yellow bell pepper\n22. pig and box truck\n23. terrier and semi-trailer truck\n24. chiller truck and red bell pepper\n25. cat and mutt\n26. Dalmatian and chiller truck\n27. loader and Dalmatian\n28. chiller truck and full-trailer truck\n29. box truck and yellow bell pepper\n30. cat and onion\n31. potato and motorcycle\n32. toucan and mutt\n33. pumpkin and full-trailer truck\n34. green bell pepper and toucan\n35. Dalmatian and carrot\n36. bee and potato\n37. crane and semi-trailer truck\n38. terrier and school bus\n39. Dalmatian and car\n40. onion and semi-trailer truck\n41. loader and onion\n42. pumpkin and yellow bell pepper\n43. bee and semi-trailer truck\n44. toucan and red bell pepper\n45. box truck and semi-trailer truck\n46. Dalmatian and potato\n47. onion and chiller truck\n48. toucan and yellow bell pepper\n49. loader and toucan\n50. crane and red bell pepper\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
