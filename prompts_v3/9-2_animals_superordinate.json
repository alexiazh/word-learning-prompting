A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three purps:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. toucan\n3. pig\n\nNow pick out the other purps from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. car\n3. loader\n4. green bell pepper\n5. box truck\n6. basset hound\n7. cat\n8. carrot\n9. bee\n10. onion\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador\n13. crane\n14. full-trailer truck\n15. school bus\n16. seal\n17. chiller truck\n18. eggplant\n19. Dalmatian\n20. bear\n21. red bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. Dalmatian and carrot\n2. semi-trailer truck and onion\n3. loader and onion\n4. Dalmatian and terrier\n5. tractor and pig\n6. pumpkin and toucan\n7. onion and school bus\n8. pig and yellow bell pepper\n9. Dalmatian and school bus\n10. mutt and chiller truck\n11. toucan and full-trailer truck\n12. crane and potato\n13. pumpkin and car\n14. box truck and potato\n15. semi-trailer truck and car\n16. crane and toucan\n17. mutt and full-trailer truck\n18. car and full-trailer truck\n19. garbage truck and school bus\n20. Labrador and pumpkin\n21. tractor and terrier\n22. eggplant and car\n23. loader and green bell pepper\n24. bear and chiller truck\n25. box truck and onion\n26. mutt and red bell pepper\n27. semi-trailer truck and full-trailer truck\n28. loader and pumpkin\n29. garbage truck and pig\n30. car and terrier\n31. pig and potato\n32. Dalmatian and car\n33. green bell pepper and chiller truck\n34. loader and mutt\n35. seal and terrier\n36. bee and toucan\n37. mutt and basset hound\n38. garbage truck and semi-trailer truck\n39. full-trailer truck and terrier\n40. mutt and bee\n41. onion and car\n42. tractor and bee\n43. pig and onion\n44. box truck and terrier\n45. basset hound and onion\n46. motorcycle and basset hound\n47. crane and green bell pepper\n48. garbage truck and bee\n49. crane and Labrador\n50. garbage truck and terrier\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
