A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three koots:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. red bell pepper\n3. yellow bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other koots from the following list:\n1. box truck\n2. red bell pepper\n3. bee\n4. crane\n5. bear\n6. onion\n7. seal\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. cat\n10. green bell pepper\n11. basset hound\n12. full-trailer truck\n13. carrot\n14. pumpkin\n15. chiller truck\n16. eggplant\n17. Labrador\n18. school bus\n19. loader\n20. Dalmatian\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. eggplant and school bus\n2. potato and cat\n3. car and pig\n4. semi-trailer truck and crane\n5. full-trailer truck and chiller truck\n6. bee and cat\n7. crane and garbage truck\n8. yellow bell pepper and potato\n9. seal and semi-trailer truck\n10. bee and full-trailer truck\n11. motorcycle and mutt\n12. car and motorcycle\n13. terrier and motorcycle\n14. car and potato\n15. onion and terrier\n16. carrot and semi-trailer truck\n17. yellow bell pepper and red bell pepper\n18. carrot and Labrador\n19. onion and loader\n20. seal and pumpkin\n21. eggplant and seal\n22. toucan and full-trailer truck\n23. box truck and carrot\n24. box truck and bee\n25. red bell pepper and bear\n26. semi-trailer truck and tractor\n27. toucan and loader\n28. red bell pepper and Labrador\n29. potato and tractor\n30. school bus and bear\n31. carrot and chiller truck\n32. box truck and Labrador\n33. yellow bell pepper and pig\n34. semi-trailer truck and garbage truck\n35. eggplant and pumpkin\n36. box truck and chiller truck\n37. Dalmatian and garbage truck\n38. red bell pepper and loader\n39. tractor and garbage truck\n40. chiller truck and Labrador\n41. green bell pepper and motorcycle\n42. Dalmatian and crane\n43. terrier and seal\n44. basset hound and school bus\n45. terrier and pumpkin\n46. cat and basset hound\n47. yellow bell pepper and carrot\n48. box truck and bear\n49. toucan and cat\n50. yellow bell pepper and eggplant\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
