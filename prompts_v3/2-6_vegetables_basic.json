A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three koots:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. red bell pepper\n3. yellow bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other koots from the following list:\n1. box truck\n2. red bell pepper\n3. bee\n4. crane\n5. bear\n6. onion\n7. seal\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. cat\n10. green bell pepper\n11. basset hound\n12. full-trailer truck\n13. carrot\n14. pumpkin\n15. chiller truck\n16. eggplant\n17. Labrador\n18. school bus\n19. loader\n20. Dalmatian\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. semi-trailer truck and motorcycle\n2. car and box truck\n3. tractor and mutt\n4. full-trailer truck and crane\n5. carrot and bear\n6. full-trailer truck and basset hound\n7. yellow bell pepper and Labrador\n8. pig and tractor\n9. car and semi-trailer truck\n10. eggplant and carrot\n11. box truck and toucan\n12. toucan and Dalmatian\n13. seal and pig\n14. box truck and semi-trailer truck\n15. chiller truck and crane\n16. cat and mutt\n17. Dalmatian and pumpkin\n18. bee and crane\n19. car and crane\n20. semi-trailer truck and Labrador\n21. green bell pepper and basset hound\n22. mutt and bear\n23. seal and chiller truck\n24. Labrador and crane\n25. car and green bell pepper\n26. terrier and eggplant\n27. potato and Dalmatian\n28. eggplant and cat\n29. eggplant and Dalmatian\n30. toucan and mutt\n31. red bell pepper and green bell pepper\n32. semi-trailer truck and basset hound\n33. eggplant and crane\n34. car and cat\n35. toucan and motorcycle\n36. loader and Labrador\n37. full-trailer truck and tractor\n38. potato and crane\n39. pig and school bus\n40. terrier and school bus\n41. box truck and pig\n42. terrier and mutt\n43. mutt and school bus\n44. box truck and mutt\n45. onion and semi-trailer truck\n46. carrot and bee\n47. Dalmatian and tractor\n48. toucan and crane\n49. bee and loader\n50. onion and full-trailer truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
