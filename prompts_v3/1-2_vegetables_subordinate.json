A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a fep:\n1. green bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other feps from the following list:\n1. crane\n2. red bell pepper\n3. seal\n4. onion\n5. Labrador\n6. chiller truck\n7. yellow bell pepper\n8. pumpkin\n9. box truck\n10. cat\n11. car\n12. basset hound\n13. bear\n14. Dalmatian\n15. green bell pepper\n16. eggplant\n17. bee\n18. full-trailer truck\n19. carrot\n20. loader\n21. school bus\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. loader and tractor\n2. eggplant and full-trailer truck\n3. bear and pig\n4. cat and school bus\n5. loader and Labrador\n6. green bell pepper and onion\n7. Dalmatian and pig\n8. garbage truck and onion\n9. carrot and yellow bell pepper\n10. basset hound and full-trailer truck\n11. tractor and motorcycle\n12. terrier and chiller truck\n13. pig and motorcycle\n14. toucan and potato\n15. onion and eggplant\n16. crane and pig\n17. terrier and car\n18. pumpkin and loader\n19. cat and car\n20. crane and car\n21. tractor and potato\n22. bee and yellow bell pepper\n23. bear and red bell pepper\n24. loader and potato\n25. bear and school bus\n26. toucan and Labrador\n27. pumpkin and semi-trailer truck\n28. basset hound and mutt\n29. green bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n30. green bell pepper and seal\n31. onion and yellow bell pepper\n32. garbage truck and Labrador\n33. school bus and car\n34. cat and seal\n35. green bell pepper and crane\n36. green bell pepper and potato\n37. eggplant and terrier\n38. motorcycle and full-trailer truck\n39. onion and terrier\n40. crane and chiller truck\n41. toucan and chiller truck\n42. loader and garbage truck\n43. cat and potato\n44. green bell pepper and terrier\n45. full-trailer truck and car\n46. potato and yellow bell pepper\n47. Dalmatian and seal\n48. green bell pepper and tractor\n49. pig and Labrador\n50. pumpkin and terrier\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
