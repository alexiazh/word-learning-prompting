A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three deeks:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. mutt\n3. terrier\n\nNow pick out the other deeks from the following list:\n1. bear\n2. chiller truck\n3. yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck\n5. basset hound\n6. seal\n7. carrot\n8. car\n9. onion\n10. crane\n11. pumpkin\n12. red bell pepper\n13. school bus\n14. bee\n15. Dalmatian\n16. Labrador\n17. cat\n18. eggplant\n19. loader\n20. box truck\n21. green bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. basset hound and eggplant\n2. chiller truck and school bus\n3. pig and Labrador\n4. semi-trailer truck and bee\n5. basset hound and onion\n6. green bell pepper and Labrador\n7. green bell pepper and bee\n8. motorcycle and potato\n9. Dalmatian and red bell pepper\n10. school bus and toucan\n11. full-trailer truck and semi-trailer truck\n12. loader and bear\n13. tractor and bear\n14. bee and bear\n15. school bus and eggplant\n16. toucan and eggplant\n17. box truck and car\n18. seal and chiller truck\n19. mutt and toucan\n20. red bell pepper and carrot\n21. motorcycle and full-trailer truck\n22. chiller truck and eggplant\n23. tractor and terrier\n24. cat and carrot\n25. semi-trailer truck and carrot\n26. box truck and onion\n27. red bell pepper and Labrador\n28. seal and red bell pepper\n29. toucan and car\n30. green bell pepper and red bell pepper\n31. red bell pepper and school bus\n32. tractor and semi-trailer truck\n33. loader and cat\n34. semi-trailer truck and basset hound\n35. crane and tractor\n36. semi-trailer truck and car\n37. chiller truck and red bell pepper\n38. crane and chiller truck\n39. motorcycle and mutt\n40. full-trailer truck and bear\n41. semi-trailer truck and potato\n42. potato and car\n43. seal and onion\n44. full-trailer truck and loader\n45. yellow bell pepper and carrot\n46. loader and car\n47. pumpkin and toucan\n48. yellow bell pepper and eggplant\n49. motorcycle and loader\n50. bee and Labrador\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
