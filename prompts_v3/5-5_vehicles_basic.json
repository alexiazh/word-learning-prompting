A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three staws:\n1. box truck\n2. semi-trailer truck\n3. garbage truck\n\nNow pick out the other staws from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. Dalmatian\n3. seal\n4. box truck\n5. crane\n6. eggplant\n7. bear\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. full-trailer truck\n10. cat\n11. loader\n12. Labrador\n13. bee\n14. onion\n15. red bell pepper\n16. pumpkin\n17. school bus\n18. chiller truck\n19. green bell pepper\n20. basset hound\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. Dalmatian and basset hound\n2. chiller truck and garbage truck\n3. pumpkin and basset hound\n4. full-trailer truck and tractor\n5. terrier and basset hound\n6. seal and chiller truck\n7. motorcycle and chiller truck\n8. chiller truck and pig\n9. yellow bell pepper and onion\n10. crane and seal\n11. motorcycle and box truck\n12. school bus and green bell pepper\n13. terrier and bear\n14. full-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n15. motorcycle and basset hound\n16. yellow bell pepper and Dalmatian\n17. cat and garbage truck\n18. cat and eggplant\n19. box truck and yellow bell pepper\n20. school bus and red bell pepper\n21. cat and pig\n22. bee and basset hound\n23. red bell pepper and pig\n24. bee and Dalmatian\n25. bee and school bus\n26. seal and eggplant\n27. red bell pepper and basset hound\n28. mutt and carrot\n29. crane and basset hound\n30. semi-trailer truck and seal\n31. potato and garbage truck\n32. motorcycle and pig\n33. toucan and Dalmatian\n34. school bus and onion\n35. motorcycle and full-trailer truck\n36. green bell pepper and garbage truck\n37. mutt and Dalmatian\n38. motorcycle and tractor\n39. bear and onion\n40. full-trailer truck and car\n41. cat and Labrador\n42. potato and tractor\n43. semi-trailer truck and garbage truck\n44. yellow bell pepper and Labrador\n45. semi-trailer truck and crane\n46. seal and green bell pepper\n47. car and eggplant\n48. mutt and box truck\n49. toucan and carrot\n50. motorcycle and garbage truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
