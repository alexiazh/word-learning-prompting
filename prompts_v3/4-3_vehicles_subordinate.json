A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a lig:\n1. box truck\n\nNow pick out the other ligs from the following list:\n1. car\n2. full-trailer truck\n3. Labrador\n4. box truck\n5. carrot\n6. bee\n7. green bell pepper\n8. bear\n9. basset hound\n10. red bell pepper\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. cat\n13. pumpkin\n14. onion\n15. loader\n16. school bus\n17. Dalmatian\n18. eggplant\n19. chiller truck\n20. seal\n21. crane\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. car and toucan\n2. green bell pepper and carrot\n3. tractor and mutt\n4. Dalmatian and red bell pepper\n5. cat and loader\n6. school bus and green bell pepper\n7. bear and chiller truck\n8. box truck and red bell pepper\n9. pig and toucan\n10. pumpkin and carrot\n11. full-trailer truck and Labrador\n12. school bus and yellow bell pepper\n13. crane and garbage truck\n14. school bus and pumpkin\n15. pumpkin and red bell pepper\n16. potato and cat\n17. red bell pepper and bee\n18. red bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n19. pumpkin and cat\n20. yellow bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n21. pumpkin and eggplant\n22. school bus and motorcycle\n23. car and bee\n24. cat and bee\n25. yellow bell pepper and eggplant\n26. tractor and bee\n27. terrier and toucan\n28. onion and Labrador\n29. bear and basset hound\n30. potato and garbage truck\n31. bear and full-trailer truck\n32. crane and pig\n33. Dalmatian and Labrador\n34. potato and toucan\n35. bear and cat\n36. pig and mutt\n37. garbage truck and tractor\n38. semi-trailer truck and basset hound\n39. yellow bell pepper and Dalmatian\n40. green bell pepper and terrier\n41. green bell pepper and pig\n42. onion and carrot\n43. semi-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n44. Labrador and toucan\n45. carrot and pig\n46. chiller truck and motorcycle\n47. bear and seal\n48. tractor and full-trailer truck\n49. crane and terrier\n50. basset hound and yellow bell pepper\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
