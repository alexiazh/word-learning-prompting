    "prompt_to_run": "You will be given a task consisting of two parts:\n1. A word-learning phase where you will be shown examples of a new word and give a similarity score of the word.\n2. A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three shars:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. potato\n3. eggplant\n\nNow pick out the other shars from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. bee\n3. green bell pepper\n4. crane\n5. basset hound\n6. full-trailer truck\n7. Labrador\n8. eggplant\n9. yellow bell pepper\n10. bear\n11. loader\n12. car\n13. box truck\n14. school bus\n15. carrot\n16. red bell pepper\n17. onion\n18. cat\n19. chiller truck\n20. Dalmatian\n21. seal\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. Dalmatian and school bus\n2. yellow bell pepper and crane\n3. seal and box truck\n4. seal and Labrador\n5. seal and loader\n6. potato and terrier\n7. crane and box truck\n8. garbage truck and crane\n9. mutt and car\n10. Dalmatian and Labrador\n11. mutt and Labrador\n12. semi-trailer truck and potato\n13. mutt and cat\n14. bear and Dalmatian\n15. Labrador and box truck\n16. full-trailer truck and green bell pepper\n17. school bus and chiller truck\n18. onion and loader\n19. yellow bell pepper and pig\n20. red bell pepper and box truck\n21. semi-trailer truck and toucan\n22. bear and toucan\n23. Dalmatian and carrot\n24. pumpkin and school bus\n25. red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n26. tractor and seal\n27. seal and full-trailer truck\n28. motorcycle and chiller truck\n29. semi-trailer truck and carrot\n30. onion and Labrador\n31. red bell pepper and toucan\n32. bee and mutt\n33. Dalmatian and crane\n34. terrier and crane\n35. yellow bell pepper and carrot\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
