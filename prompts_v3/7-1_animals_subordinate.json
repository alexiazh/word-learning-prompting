A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a bub:\n1. Dalmatian\n\nNow pick out the other bubs from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. bee\n3. onion\n4. loader\n5. green bell pepper\n6. eggplant\n7. basset hound\n8. Labrador\n9. cat\n10. red bell pepper\n11. box truck\n12. bear\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. school bus\n16. car\n17. seal\n18. pumpkin\n19. crane\n20. Dalmatian\n21. full-trailer truck\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. tractor and onion\n2. bee and tractor\n3. pig and potato\n4. potato and basset hound\n5. motorcycle and box truck\n6. crane and tractor\n7. bee and semi-trailer truck\n8. car and eggplant\n9. full-trailer truck and eggplant\n10. car and carrot\n11. chiller truck and seal\n12. cat and school bus\n13. chiller truck and pig\n14. chiller truck and Dalmatian\n15. chiller truck and loader\n16. mutt and seal\n17. full-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n18. bear and onion\n19. loader and garbage truck\n20. Dalmatian and bee\n21. motorcycle and bee\n22. Labrador and seal\n23. green bell pepper and school bus\n24. cat and crane\n25. pig and Labrador\n26. cat and terrier\n27. pumpkin and garbage truck\n28. cat and garbage truck\n29. pig and yellow bell pepper\n30. potato and yellow bell pepper\n31. car and semi-trailer truck\n32. motorcycle and crane\n33. Labrador and terrier\n34. eggplant and onion\n35. eggplant and yellow bell pepper\n36. pumpkin and mutt\n37. semi-trailer truck and garbage truck\n38. crane and school bus\n39. bee and carrot\n40. red bell pepper and box truck\n41. school bus and garbage truck\n42. green bell pepper and terrier\n43. bee and onion\n44. green bell pepper and pumpkin\n45. toucan and eggplant\n46. green bell pepper and seal\n47. red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n48. bee and eggplant\n49. chiller truck and motorcycle\n50. school bus and tractor\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
