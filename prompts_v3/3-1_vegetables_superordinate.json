A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three shars:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. potato\n3. eggplant\n\nNow pick out the other shars from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. bee\n3. green bell pepper\n4. crane\n5. basset hound\n6. full-trailer truck\n7. Labrador\n8. eggplant\n9. yellow bell pepper\n10. bear\n11. loader\n12. car\n13. box truck\n14. school bus\n15. carrot\n16. red bell pepper\n17. onion\n18. cat\n19. chiller truck\n20. Dalmatian\n21. seal\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. tractor and pig\n2. Labrador and carrot\n3. green bell pepper and car\n4. pumpkin and motorcycle\n5. seal and eggplant\n6. eggplant and bear\n7. semi-trailer truck and terrier\n8. pig and car\n9. pumpkin and onion\n10. motorcycle and bear\n11. seal and green bell pepper\n12. motorcycle and loader\n13. tractor and car\n14. tractor and loader\n15. pumpkin and semi-trailer truck\n16. garbage truck and school bus\n17. bee and pig\n18. pumpkin and basset hound\n19. motorcycle and bee\n20. motorcycle and toucan\n21. pumpkin and terrier\n22. tractor and full-trailer truck\n23. red bell pepper and green bell pepper\n24. Dalmatian and basset hound\n25. green bell pepper and toucan\n26. basset hound and toucan\n27. tractor and chiller truck\n28. bear and mutt\n29. school bus and Labrador\n30. onion and car\n31. eggplant and loader\n32. bear and chiller truck\n33. semi-trailer truck and basset hound\n34. garbage truck and yellow bell pepper\n35. full-trailer truck and potato\n36. mutt and carrot\n37. seal and potato\n38. pumpkin and crane\n39. garbage truck and carrot\n40. seal and bee\n41. school bus and yellow bell pepper\n42. full-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n43. full-trailer truck and toucan\n44. car and crane\n45. tractor and bee\n46. loader and yellow bell pepper\n47. cat and car\n48. car and box truck\n49. garbage truck and car\n50. Dalmatian and box truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
