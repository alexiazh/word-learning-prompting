A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three shars:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. potato\n3. eggplant\n\nNow pick out the other shars from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. bee\n3. green bell pepper\n4. crane\n5. basset hound\n6. full-trailer truck\n7. Labrador\n8. eggplant\n9. yellow bell pepper\n10. bear\n11. loader\n12. car\n13. box truck\n14. school bus\n15. carrot\n16. red bell pepper\n17. onion\n18. cat\n19. chiller truck\n20. Dalmatian\n21. seal\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. Labrador and toucan\n2. mutt and crane\n3. loader and toucan\n4. eggplant and mutt\n5. pig and crane\n6. onion and red bell pepper\n7. motorcycle and red bell pepper\n8. bear and box truck\n9. semi-trailer truck and red bell pepper\n10. full-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n11. red bell pepper and carrot\n12. onion and Dalmatian\n13. potato and green bell pepper\n14. full-trailer truck and basset hound\n15. motorcycle and box truck\n16. eggplant and school bus\n17. cat and yellow bell pepper\n18. semi-trailer truck and car\n19. school bus and potato\n20. mutt and box truck\n21. full-trailer truck and pig\n22. motorcycle and full-trailer truck\n23. pumpkin and box truck\n24. semi-trailer truck and chiller truck\n25. pumpkin and chiller truck\n26. motorcycle and tractor\n27. semi-trailer truck and pig\n28. Dalmatian and car\n29. motorcycle and mutt\n30. Dalmatian and loader\n31. eggplant and bee\n32. carrot and toucan\n33. onion and toucan\n34. pig and box truck\n35. full-trailer truck and red bell pepper\n36. tractor and box truck\n37. tractor and Dalmatian\n38. seal and semi-trailer truck\n39. bear and green bell pepper\n40. motorcycle and school bus\n41. tractor and cat\n42. potato and box truck\n43. pumpkin and tractor\n44. garbage truck and red bell pepper\n45. bee and green bell pepper\n46. cat and terrier\n47. pumpkin and carrot\n48. cat and potato\n49. yellow bell pepper and terrier\n50. pumpkin and cat\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
