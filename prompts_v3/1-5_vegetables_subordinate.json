A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a fep:\n1. green bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other feps from the following list:\n1. crane\n2. red bell pepper\n3. seal\n4. onion\n5. Labrador\n6. chiller truck\n7. yellow bell pepper\n8. pumpkin\n9. box truck\n10. cat\n11. car\n12. basset hound\n13. bear\n14. Dalmatian\n15. green bell pepper\n16. eggplant\n17. bee\n18. full-trailer truck\n19. carrot\n20. loader\n21. school bus\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. green bell pepper and basset hound\n2. bear and full-trailer truck\n3. red bell pepper and school bus\n4. seal and eggplant\n5. bear and eggplant\n6. terrier and potato\n7. Dalmatian and crane\n8. green bell pepper and carrot\n9. Dalmatian and semi-trailer truck\n10. cat and Dalmatian\n11. bear and bee\n12. pumpkin and bear\n13. onion and red bell pepper\n14. basset hound and school bus\n15. cat and Labrador\n16. pumpkin and onion\n17. Dalmatian and full-trailer truck\n18. loader and mutt\n19. bee and car\n20. motorcycle and school bus\n21. Dalmatian and tractor\n22. loader and motorcycle\n23. chiller truck and school bus\n24. loader and terrier\n25. garbage truck and chiller truck\n26. pumpkin and mutt\n27. pumpkin and seal\n28. terrier and Labrador\n29. green bell pepper and motorcycle\n30. bee and carrot\n31. cat and box truck\n32. Dalmatian and terrier\n33. crane and box truck\n34. mutt and car\n35. eggplant and semi-trailer truck\n36. carrot and school bus\n37. red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n38. toucan and basset hound\n39. Dalmatian and onion\n40. Dalmatian and toucan\n41. bear and terrier\n42. box truck and full-trailer truck\n43. garbage truck and motorcycle\n44. garbage truck and car\n45. tractor and full-trailer truck\n46. green bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n47. loader and semi-trailer truck\n48. garbage truck and mutt\n49. basset hound and yellow bell pepper\n50. bee and red bell pepper\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
