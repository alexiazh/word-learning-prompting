A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. school bus\n2. pumpkin\n3. bear\n4. cat\n5. Labrador\n6. carrot\n7. green bell pepper\n8. onion\n9. bee\n10. box truck\n11. crane\n12. car\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. Dalmatian\n16. basset hound\n17. seal\n18. eggplant\n19. full-trailer truck\n20. red bell pepper\n21. loader\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. yellow bell pepper and Labrador\n2. mutt and toucan\n3. green bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n4. tractor and onion\n5. green bell pepper and chiller truck\n6. mutt and bear\n7. green bell pepper and loader\n8. garbage truck and Labrador\n9. green bell pepper and Dalmatian\n10. bear and motorcycle\n11. bear and pig\n12. crane and school bus\n13. pig and Labrador\n14. semi-trailer truck and car\n15. red bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n16. toucan and Labrador\n17. carrot and basset hound\n18. potato and pig\n19. motorcycle and toucan\n20. tractor and car\n21. red bell pepper and toucan\n22. mutt and red bell pepper\n23. cat and Labrador\n24. car and toucan\n25. carrot and pig\n26. pig and Dalmatian\n27. box truck and toucan\n28. seal and tractor\n29. terrier and carrot\n30. cat and carrot\n31. school bus and basset hound\n32. carrot and bear\n33. green bell pepper and onion\n34. terrier and semi-trailer truck\n35. semi-trailer truck and tractor\n36. mutt and chiller truck\n37. potato and red bell pepper\n38. crane and Labrador\n39. terrier and bear\n40. potato and semi-trailer truck\n41. terrier and pumpkin\n42. terrier and Dalmatian\n43. loader and school bus\n44. semi-trailer truck and basset hound\n45. pig and onion\n46. bear and school bus\n47. yellow bell pepper and Dalmatian\n48. yellow bell pepper and tractor\n49. bee and motorcycle\n50. car and onion\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
