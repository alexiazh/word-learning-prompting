A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a lig:\n1. box truck\n\nNow pick out the other ligs from the following list:\n1. car\n2. full-trailer truck\n3. Labrador\n4. box truck\n5. carrot\n6. bee\n7. green bell pepper\n8. bear\n9. basset hound\n10. red bell pepper\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. cat\n13. pumpkin\n14. onion\n15. loader\n16. school bus\n17. Dalmatian\n18. eggplant\n19. chiller truck\n20. seal\n21. crane\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. terrier and pig\n2. basset hound and loader\n3. full-trailer truck and toucan\n4. green bell pepper and box truck\n5. semi-trailer truck and full-trailer truck\n6. pumpkin and green bell pepper\n7. green bell pepper and eggplant\n8. chiller truck and carrot\n9. basset hound and full-trailer truck\n10. semi-trailer truck and seal\n11. chiller truck and tractor\n12. basset hound and tractor\n13. potato and terrier\n14. garbage truck and toucan\n15. carrot and motorcycle\n16. semi-trailer truck and carrot\n17. tractor and pig\n18. eggplant and pig\n19. onion and crane\n20. onion and tractor\n21. bear and toucan\n22. eggplant and tractor\n23. cat and terrier\n24. eggplant and full-trailer truck\n25. bear and Labrador\n26. carrot and garbage truck\n27. semi-trailer truck and cat\n28. yellow bell pepper and bee\n29. red bell pepper and terrier\n30. potato and chiller truck\n31. loader and chiller truck\n32. onion and yellow bell pepper\n33. crane and mutt\n34. car and mutt\n35. seal and Dalmatian\n36. box truck and toucan\n37. green bell pepper and tractor\n38. yellow bell pepper and mutt\n39. basset hound and box truck\n40. seal and motorcycle\n41. pumpkin and loader\n42. car and onion\n43. pumpkin and semi-trailer truck\n44. car and carrot\n45. carrot and bee\n46. cat and chiller truck\n47. green bell pepper and chiller truck\n48. eggplant and terrier\n49. pumpkin and garbage truck\n50. carrot and terrier\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
