    "prompt_to_run": "You will be given a task consisting of two parts:\n1. A word-learning phase where you will be shown examples of a new word and give a similarity score of the word.\n2. A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a bub:\n1. Dalmatian\n\nNow pick out the other bubs from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. bee\n3. onion\n4. loader\n5. green bell pepper\n6. eggplant\n7. basset hound\n8. Labrador\n9. cat\n10. red bell pepper\n11. box truck\n12. bear\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. school bus\n16. car\n17. seal\n18. pumpkin\n19. crane\n20. Dalmatian\n21. full-trailer truck\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. full-trailer truck and motorcycle\n2. motorcycle and onion\n3. toucan and carrot\n4. green bell pepper and basset hound\n5. motorcycle and cat\n6. garbage truck and bear\n7. red bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n8. red bell pepper and pumpkin\n9. potato and seal\n10. motorcycle and red bell pepper\n11. chiller truck and bee\n12. toucan and crane\n13. basset hound and bear\n14. chiller truck and green bell pepper\n15. potato and tractor\n16. basset hound and red bell pepper\n17. car and crane\n18. potato and school bus\n19. carrot and tractor\n20. terrier and red bell pepper\n21. chiller truck and red bell pepper\n22. Dalmatian and Labrador\n23. crane and seal\n24. motorcycle and eggplant\n25. garbage truck and onion\n26. mutt and yellow bell pepper\n27. carrot and box truck\n28. chiller truck and school bus\n29. cat and basset hound\n30. green bell pepper and onion\n31. green bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n32. semi-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n33. terrier and onion\n34. Dalmatian and carrot\n35. green bell pepper and Dalmatian\n36. green bell pepper and mutt\n37. yellow bell pepper and seal\n38. eggplant and pumpkin\n39. loader and seal\n40. potato and cat\n41. Dalmatian and semi-trailer truck\n42. Labrador and bee\n43. car and box truck\n44. red bell pepper and garbage truck\n45. full-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n46. school bus and bear\n47. full-trailer truck and car\n48. pig and tractor\n49. basset hound and carrot\n50. car and toucan\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
