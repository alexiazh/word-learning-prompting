A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three koots:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. red bell pepper\n3. yellow bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other koots from the following list:\n1. box truck\n2. red bell pepper\n3. bee\n4. crane\n5. bear\n6. onion\n7. seal\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. cat\n10. green bell pepper\n11. basset hound\n12. full-trailer truck\n13. carrot\n14. pumpkin\n15. chiller truck\n16. eggplant\n17. Labrador\n18. school bus\n19. loader\n20. Dalmatian\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. car and basset hound\n2. Dalmatian and loader\n3. cat and garbage truck\n4. full-trailer truck and mutt\n5. semi-trailer truck and bear\n6. cat and crane\n7. terrier and carrot\n8. chiller truck and school bus\n9. pumpkin and school bus\n10. terrier and box truck\n11. eggplant and semi-trailer truck\n12. carrot and toucan\n13. pig and semi-trailer truck\n14. mutt and crane\n15. bee and mutt\n16. yellow bell pepper and motorcycle\n17. onion and seal\n18. box truck and Dalmatian\n19. green bell pepper and tractor\n20. carrot and full-trailer truck\n21. yellow bell pepper and crane\n22. crane and bear\n23. carrot and pig\n24. eggplant and bear\n25. carrot and seal\n26. potato and pig\n27. bee and pumpkin\n28. Dalmatian and mutt\n29. red bell pepper and Dalmatian\n30. bee and basset hound\n31. carrot and loader\n32. car and Labrador\n33. toucan and tractor\n34. pig and motorcycle\n35. bee and chiller truck\n36. potato and motorcycle\n37. green bell pepper and school bus\n38. eggplant and pig\n39. pumpkin and loader\n40. motorcycle and school bus\n41. car and yellow bell pepper\n42. yellow bell pepper and bee\n43. Dalmatian and semi-trailer truck\n44. terrier and full-trailer truck\n45. pumpkin and Labrador\n46. potato and box truck\n47. chiller truck and garbage truck\n48. chiller truck and cat\n49. onion and Dalmatian\n50. Dalmatian and Labrador\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
