A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a fep:\n1. green bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other feps from the following list:\n1. crane\n2. red bell pepper\n3. seal\n4. onion\n5. Labrador\n6. chiller truck\n7. yellow bell pepper\n8. pumpkin\n9. box truck\n10. cat\n11. car\n12. basset hound\n13. bear\n14. Dalmatian\n15. green bell pepper\n16. eggplant\n17. bee\n18. full-trailer truck\n19. carrot\n20. loader\n21. school bus\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. loader and full-trailer truck\n2. garbage truck and terrier\n3. garbage truck and school bus\n4. green bell pepper and chiller truck\n5. pig and carrot\n6. cat and tractor\n7. tractor and eggplant\n8. pumpkin and pig\n9. seal and semi-trailer truck\n10. bee and basset hound\n11. loader and crane\n12. eggplant and Labrador\n13. bear and car\n14. onion and car\n15. cat and carrot\n16. pumpkin and tractor\n17. pumpkin and crane\n18. basset hound and semi-trailer truck\n19. chiller truck and car\n20. full-trailer truck and Labrador\n21. seal and motorcycle\n22. bee and mutt\n23. bee and seal\n24. garbage truck and red bell pepper\n25. carrot and mutt\n26. onion and full-trailer truck\n27. pumpkin and toucan\n28. carrot and semi-trailer truck\n29. pumpkin and red bell pepper\n30. green bell pepper and bee\n31. crane and terrier\n32. garbage truck and tractor\n33. green bell pepper and Dalmatian\n34. pumpkin and chiller truck\n35. seal and chiller truck\n36. Dalmatian and bee\n37. bear and Labrador\n38. pumpkin and Labrador\n39. tractor and school bus\n40. motorcycle and yellow bell pepper\n41. pig and school bus\n42. potato and full-trailer truck\n43. pumpkin and eggplant\n44. potato and Labrador\n45. Dalmatian and mutt\n46. loader and basset hound\n47. pig and basset hound\n48. potato and semi-trailer truck\n49. yellow bell pepper and Labrador\n50. tractor and bee\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
