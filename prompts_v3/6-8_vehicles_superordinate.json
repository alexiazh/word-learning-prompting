A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. school bus\n2. pumpkin\n3. bear\n4. cat\n5. Labrador\n6. carrot\n7. green bell pepper\n8. onion\n9. bee\n10. box truck\n11. crane\n12. car\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. Dalmatian\n16. basset hound\n17. seal\n18. eggplant\n19. full-trailer truck\n20. red bell pepper\n21. loader\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. cat and crane\n2. carrot and red bell pepper\n3. bee and school bus\n4. terrier and onion\n5. seal and Labrador\n6. eggplant and yellow bell pepper\n7. terrier and cat\n8. eggplant and basset hound\n9. green bell pepper and bear\n10. terrier and basset hound\n11. tractor and Labrador\n12. eggplant and Labrador\n13. yellow bell pepper and toucan\n14. loader and bear\n15. seal and yellow bell pepper\n16. loader and motorcycle\n17. terrier and garbage truck\n18. pumpkin and Dalmatian\n19. tractor and school bus\n20. chiller truck and red bell pepper\n21. bee and pumpkin\n22. garbage truck and yellow bell pepper\n23. terrier and motorcycle\n24. pumpkin and onion\n25. cat and onion\n26. cat and basset hound\n27. car and full-trailer truck\n28. motorcycle and Labrador\n29. green bell pepper and toucan\n30. mutt and loader\n31. chiller truck and basset hound\n32. eggplant and mutt\n33. potato and bear\n34. chiller truck and Dalmatian\n35. yellow bell pepper and carrot\n36. crane and onion\n37. crane and toucan\n38. school bus and onion\n39. seal and semi-trailer truck\n40. garbage truck and carrot\n41. box truck and Labrador\n42. car and Dalmatian\n43. basset hound and onion\n44. potato and tractor\n45. green bell pepper and crane\n46. semi-trailer truck and crane\n47. seal and bear\n48. terrier and crane\n49. cat and yellow bell pepper\n50. bee and tractor\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
