A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three deeks:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. mutt\n3. terrier\n\nNow pick out the other deeks from the following list:\n1. bear\n2. chiller truck\n3. yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck\n5. basset hound\n6. seal\n7. carrot\n8. car\n9. onion\n10. crane\n11. pumpkin\n12. red bell pepper\n13. school bus\n14. bee\n15. Dalmatian\n16. Labrador\n17. cat\n18. eggplant\n19. loader\n20. box truck\n21. green bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. mutt and pig\n2. terrier and loader\n3. tractor and pig\n4. garbage truck and pig\n5. green bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n6. box truck and pumpkin\n7. green bell pepper and basset hound\n8. seal and terrier\n9. terrier and pumpkin\n10. basset hound and cat\n11. crane and cat\n12. semi-trailer truck and cat\n13. terrier and car\n14. basset hound and potato\n15. seal and basset hound\n16. garbage truck and chiller truck\n17. bear and car\n18. Dalmatian and basset hound\n19. loader and toucan\n20. box truck and yellow bell pepper\n21. crane and mutt\n22. box truck and eggplant\n23. pig and school bus\n24. motorcycle and basset hound\n25. garbage truck and school bus\n26. box truck and mutt\n27. Dalmatian and terrier\n28. motorcycle and eggplant\n29. semi-trailer truck and bear\n30. semi-trailer truck and toucan\n31. tractor and box truck\n32. potato and loader\n33. tractor and pumpkin\n34. green bell pepper and motorcycle\n35. full-trailer truck and school bus\n36. full-trailer truck and potato\n37. Labrador and school bus\n38. pumpkin and carrot\n39. motorcycle and terrier\n40. crane and carrot\n41. onion and eggplant\n42. chiller truck and potato\n43. full-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n44. full-trailer truck and cat\n45. Dalmatian and bee\n46. terrier and Labrador\n47. terrier and potato\n48. yellow bell pepper and onion\n49. crane and school bus\n50. full-trailer truck and pig\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
