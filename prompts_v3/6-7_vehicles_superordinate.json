A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. school bus\n2. pumpkin\n3. bear\n4. cat\n5. Labrador\n6. carrot\n7. green bell pepper\n8. onion\n9. bee\n10. box truck\n11. crane\n12. car\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. Dalmatian\n16. basset hound\n17. seal\n18. eggplant\n19. full-trailer truck\n20. red bell pepper\n21. loader\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. terrier and bee\n2. chiller truck and school bus\n3. eggplant and toucan\n4. chiller truck and pumpkin\n5. potato and Labrador\n6. yellow bell pepper and school bus\n7. green bell pepper and pig\n8. bee and red bell pepper\n9. potato and car\n10. eggplant and garbage truck\n11. motorcycle and onion\n12. red bell pepper and Dalmatian\n13. garbage truck and Dalmatian\n14. semi-trailer truck and school bus\n15. bee and Dalmatian\n16. mutt and pig\n17. eggplant and chiller truck\n18. loader and Labrador\n19. eggplant and cat\n20. car and red bell pepper\n21. red bell pepper and box truck\n22. loader and garbage truck\n23. bee and box truck\n24. terrier and full-trailer truck\n25. seal and pumpkin\n26. full-trailer truck and toucan\n27. garbage truck and onion\n28. tractor and bear\n29. garbage truck and full-trailer truck\n30. bear and red bell pepper\n31. chiller truck and car\n32. eggplant and car\n33. garbage truck and school bus\n34. pumpkin and school bus\n35. green bell pepper and cat\n36. potato and carrot\n37. cat and Dalmatian\n38. potato and full-trailer truck\n39. carrot and toucan\n40. school bus and pig\n41. red bell pepper and onion\n42. eggplant and tractor\n43. garbage truck and pig\n44. green bell pepper and pumpkin\n45. basset hound and Labrador\n46. crane and full-trailer truck\n47. pumpkin and car\n48. basset hound and red bell pepper\n49. mutt and box truck\n50. semi-trailer truck and box truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
