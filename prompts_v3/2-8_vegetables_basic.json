A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three koots:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. red bell pepper\n3. yellow bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other koots from the following list:\n1. box truck\n2. red bell pepper\n3. bee\n4. crane\n5. bear\n6. onion\n7. seal\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. cat\n10. green bell pepper\n11. basset hound\n12. full-trailer truck\n13. carrot\n14. pumpkin\n15. chiller truck\n16. eggplant\n17. Labrador\n18. school bus\n19. loader\n20. Dalmatian\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. pig and bear\n2. onion and carrot\n3. carrot and garbage truck\n4. potato and seal\n5. car and garbage truck\n6. green bell pepper and bear\n7. eggplant and basset hound\n8. Dalmatian and bear\n9. onion and cat\n10. terrier and bear\n11. car and toucan\n12. red bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n13. semi-trailer truck and cat\n14. green bell pepper and chiller truck\n15. chiller truck and basset hound\n16. potato and bear\n17. potato and green bell pepper\n18. yellow bell pepper and seal\n19. red bell pepper and crane\n20. yellow bell pepper and terrier\n21. yellow bell pepper and garbage truck\n22. red bell pepper and chiller truck\n23. bee and semi-trailer truck\n24. potato and Labrador\n25. onion and red bell pepper\n26. green bell pepper and loader\n27. chiller truck and motorcycle\n28. basset hound and garbage truck\n29. terrier and chiller truck\n30. onion and pig\n31. red bell pepper and terrier\n32. red bell pepper and mutt\n33. eggplant and Labrador\n34. potato and terrier\n35. motorcycle and crane\n36. seal and tractor\n37. terrier and loader\n38. car and onion\n39. loader and bear\n40. potato and red bell pepper\n41. loader and garbage truck\n42. bee and tractor\n43. eggplant and full-trailer truck\n44. yellow bell pepper and box truck\n45. onion and toucan\n46. yellow bell pepper and cat\n47. chiller truck and bear\n48. yellow bell pepper and tractor\n49. red bell pepper and eggplant\n50. eggplant and garbage truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
