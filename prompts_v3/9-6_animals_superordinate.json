A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three purps:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. toucan\n3. pig\n\nNow pick out the other purps from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. car\n3. loader\n4. green bell pepper\n5. box truck\n6. basset hound\n7. cat\n8. carrot\n9. bee\n10. onion\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador\n13. crane\n14. full-trailer truck\n15. school bus\n16. seal\n17. chiller truck\n18. eggplant\n19. Dalmatian\n20. bear\n21. red bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. motorcycle and carrot\n2. bee and car\n3. loader and box truck\n4. bee and full-trailer truck\n5. carrot and semi-trailer truck\n6. bee and chiller truck\n7. red bell pepper and onion\n8. carrot and yellow bell pepper\n9. loader and school bus\n10. pumpkin and bee\n11. seal and school bus\n12. motorcycle and full-trailer truck\n13. carrot and full-trailer truck\n14. cat and full-trailer truck\n15. pumpkin and seal\n16. Labrador and green bell pepper\n17. bear and yellow bell pepper\n18. potato and toucan\n19. green bell pepper and motorcycle\n20. crane and chiller truck\n21. toucan and terrier\n22. pumpkin and onion\n23. crane and eggplant\n24. tractor and mutt\n25. loader and toucan\n26. pumpkin and full-trailer truck\n27. loader and bee\n28. crane and basset hound\n29. pig and terrier\n30. box truck and garbage truck\n31. Labrador and full-trailer truck\n32. tractor and chiller truck\n33. full-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n34. Labrador and bee\n35. mutt and bear\n36. red bell pepper and chiller truck\n37. crane and tractor\n38. Dalmatian and box truck\n39. loader and basset hound\n40. Dalmatian and bee\n41. red bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n42. crane and pig\n43. pumpkin and red bell pepper\n44. loader and motorcycle\n45. tractor and cat\n46. motorcycle and onion\n47. semi-trailer truck and terrier\n48. red bell pepper and pig\n49. crane and loader\n50. seal and semi-trailer truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
