A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three deeks:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. mutt\n3. terrier\n\nNow pick out the other deeks from the following list:\n1. bear\n2. chiller truck\n3. yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck\n5. basset hound\n6. seal\n7. carrot\n8. car\n9. onion\n10. crane\n11. pumpkin\n12. red bell pepper\n13. school bus\n14. bee\n15. Dalmatian\n16. Labrador\n17. cat\n18. eggplant\n19. loader\n20. box truck\n21. green bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. mutt and Dalmatian\n2. seal and pig\n3. seal and car\n4. Dalmatian and yellow bell pepper\n5. pig and semi-trailer truck\n6. tractor and mutt\n7. tractor and loader\n8. carrot and toucan\n9. green bell pepper and eggplant\n10. seal and school bus\n11. bee and eggplant\n12. pig and eggplant\n13. yellow bell pepper and bee\n14. chiller truck and car\n15. garbage truck and semi-trailer truck\n16. full-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n17. green bell pepper and Dalmatian\n18. crane and car\n19. potato and Labrador\n20. mutt and terrier\n21. motorcycle and cat\n22. yellow bell pepper and car\n23. car and eggplant\n24. motorcycle and bear\n25. pig and car\n26. crane and potato\n27. bee and carrot\n28. motorcycle and car\n29. semi-trailer truck and loader\n30. terrier and red bell pepper\n31. cat and toucan\n32. potato and red bell pepper\n33. yellow bell pepper and red bell pepper\n34. pumpkin and chiller truck\n35. crane and eggplant\n36. green bell pepper and car\n37. seal and loader\n38. green bell pepper and seal\n39. pig and onion\n40. seal and motorcycle\n41. terrier and pig\n42. Dalmatian and bear\n43. seal and garbage truck\n44. basset hound and bear\n45. mutt and cat\n46. pumpkin and potato\n47. basset hound and toucan\n48. bear and Labrador\n49. terrier and chiller truck\n50. box truck and loader\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
