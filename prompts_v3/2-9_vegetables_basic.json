A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three koots:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. red bell pepper\n3. yellow bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other koots from the following list:\n1. box truck\n2. red bell pepper\n3. bee\n4. crane\n5. bear\n6. onion\n7. seal\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. cat\n10. green bell pepper\n11. basset hound\n12. full-trailer truck\n13. carrot\n14. pumpkin\n15. chiller truck\n16. eggplant\n17. Labrador\n18. school bus\n19. loader\n20. Dalmatian\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. onion and bee\n2. full-trailer truck and school bus\n3. seal and cat\n4. terrier and crane\n5. carrot and tractor\n6. car and mutt\n7. bee and pig\n8. onion and pumpkin\n9. car and carrot\n10. onion and eggplant\n11. yellow bell pepper and onion\n12. eggplant and mutt\n13. garbage truck and bear\n14. loader and school bus\n15. red bell pepper and seal\n16. terrier and Dalmatian\n17. yellow bell pepper and loader\n18. yellow bell pepper and basset hound\n19. Labrador and school bus\n20. carrot and mutt\n21. motorcycle and garbage truck\n22. onion and box truck\n23. car and pumpkin\n24. yellow bell pepper and school bus\n25. toucan and basset hound\n26. yellow bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n27. red bell pepper and cat\n28. terrier and toucan\n29. basset hound and mutt\n30. basset hound and loader\n31. car and loader\n32. cat and pumpkin\n33. green bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n34. eggplant and toucan\n35. pumpkin and crane\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
