A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a bub:\n1. Dalmatian\n\nNow pick out the other bubs from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. bee\n3. onion\n4. loader\n5. green bell pepper\n6. eggplant\n7. basset hound\n8. Labrador\n9. cat\n10. red bell pepper\n11. box truck\n12. bear\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. school bus\n16. car\n17. seal\n18. pumpkin\n19. crane\n20. Dalmatian\n21. full-trailer truck\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. Labrador and loader\n2. Dalmatian and car\n3. yellow bell pepper and garbage truck\n4. car and bear\n5. pig and semi-trailer truck\n6. motorcycle and toucan\n7. cat and tractor\n8. full-trailer truck and garbage truck\n9. full-trailer truck and onion\n10. carrot and onion\n11. car and seal\n12. basset hound and box truck\n13. yellow bell pepper and tractor\n14. loader and bear\n15. full-trailer truck and pumpkin\n16. car and pumpkin\n17. toucan and yellow bell pepper\n18. full-trailer truck and school bus\n19. pumpkin and seal\n20. Dalmatian and onion\n21. toucan and box truck\n22. toucan and bear\n23. basset hound and terrier\n24. school bus and box truck\n25. loader and semi-trailer truck\n26. loader and tractor\n27. pig and eggplant\n28. chiller truck and yellow bell pepper\n29. full-trailer truck and red bell pepper\n30. basset hound and yellow bell pepper\n31. Dalmatian and seal\n32. pig and bee\n33. basset hound and garbage truck\n34. Labrador and red bell pepper\n35. basset hound and tractor\n36. green bell pepper and crane\n37. green bell pepper and bear\n38. pumpkin and tractor\n39. green bell pepper and red bell pepper\n40. cat and eggplant\n41. Dalmatian and basset hound\n42. car and onion\n43. toucan and garbage truck\n44. pig and terrier\n45. toucan and school bus\n46. full-trailer truck and crane\n47. bee and cat\n48. yellow bell pepper and bear\n49. car and tractor\n50. terrier and mutt\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
