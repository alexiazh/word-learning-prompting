A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. school bus\n2. pumpkin\n3. bear\n4. cat\n5. Labrador\n6. carrot\n7. green bell pepper\n8. onion\n9. bee\n10. box truck\n11. crane\n12. car\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. Dalmatian\n16. basset hound\n17. seal\n18. eggplant\n19. full-trailer truck\n20. red bell pepper\n21. loader\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. terrier and toucan\n2. box truck and onion\n3. loader and yellow bell pepper\n4. cat and loader\n5. bear and box truck\n6. potato and loader\n7. full-trailer truck and onion\n8. eggplant and bee\n9. cat and box truck\n10. loader and car\n11. semi-trailer truck and onion\n12. school bus and red bell pepper\n13. cat and school bus\n14. pumpkin and box truck\n15. box truck and Dalmatian\n16. car and crane\n17. motorcycle and pig\n18. mutt and Labrador\n19. carrot and box truck\n20. school bus and motorcycle\n21. green bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n22. eggplant and semi-trailer truck\n23. cat and pumpkin\n24. seal and motorcycle\n25. potato and box truck\n26. cat and bear\n27. car and box truck\n28. eggplant and pumpkin\n29. seal and loader\n30. tractor and basset hound\n31. loader and pig\n32. school bus and Dalmatian\n33. seal and red bell pepper\n34. chiller truck and semi-trailer truck\n35. semi-trailer truck and pumpkin\n36. bee and toucan\n37. bear and Dalmatian\n38. car and school bus\n39. pig and toucan\n40. pumpkin and basset hound\n41. green bell pepper and tractor\n42. loader and toucan\n43. green bell pepper and bee\n44. green bell pepper and car\n45. mutt and crane\n46. eggplant and full-trailer truck\n47. chiller truck and tractor\n48. crane and Dalmatian\n49. loader and crane\n50. Dalmatian and toucan\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
