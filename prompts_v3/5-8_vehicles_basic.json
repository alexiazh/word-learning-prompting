A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three staws:\n1. box truck\n2. semi-trailer truck\n3. garbage truck\n\nNow pick out the other staws from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. Dalmatian\n3. seal\n4. box truck\n5. crane\n6. eggplant\n7. bear\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. full-trailer truck\n10. cat\n11. loader\n12. Labrador\n13. bee\n14. onion\n15. red bell pepper\n16. pumpkin\n17. school bus\n18. chiller truck\n19. green bell pepper\n20. basset hound\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. seal and yellow bell pepper\n2. potato and seal\n3. toucan and garbage truck\n4. mutt and school bus\n5. bear and eggplant\n6. carrot and onion\n7. crane and pumpkin\n8. bear and crane\n9. bee and garbage truck\n10. toucan and school bus\n11. eggplant and Labrador\n12. carrot and pumpkin\n13. box truck and bee\n14. red bell pepper and Labrador\n15. bee and chiller truck\n16. full-trailer truck and bear\n17. crane and tractor\n18. motorcycle and pumpkin\n19. red bell pepper and tractor\n20. green bell pepper and pig\n21. onion and green bell pepper\n22. semi-trailer truck and red bell pepper\n23. potato and mutt\n24. bee and Labrador\n25. loader and basset hound\n26. toucan and crane\n27. mutt and eggplant\n28. crane and loader\n29. crane and pig\n30. mutt and garbage truck\n31. bear and Dalmatian\n32. school bus and tractor\n33. full-trailer truck and school bus\n34. onion and Dalmatian\n35. chiller truck and Labrador\n36. bear and car\n37. crane and bee\n38. mutt and green bell pepper\n39. chiller truck and Dalmatian\n40. bear and green bell pepper\n41. box truck and tractor\n42. mutt and motorcycle\n43. car and loader\n44. toucan and seal\n45. mutt and basset hound\n46. toucan and onion\n47. bear and yellow bell pepper\n48. bee and red bell pepper\n49. garbage truck and basset hound\n50. Dalmatian and pig\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
