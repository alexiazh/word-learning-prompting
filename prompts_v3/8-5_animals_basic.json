A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three deeks:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. mutt\n3. terrier\n\nNow pick out the other deeks from the following list:\n1. bear\n2. chiller truck\n3. yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck\n5. basset hound\n6. seal\n7. carrot\n8. car\n9. onion\n10. crane\n11. pumpkin\n12. red bell pepper\n13. school bus\n14. bee\n15. Dalmatian\n16. Labrador\n17. cat\n18. eggplant\n19. loader\n20. box truck\n21. green bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. mutt and school bus\n2. chiller truck and loader\n3. loader and carrot\n4. garbage truck and red bell pepper\n5. mutt and onion\n6. crane and pumpkin\n7. terrier and school bus\n8. motorcycle and carrot\n9. terrier and cat\n10. pumpkin and red bell pepper\n11. onion and school bus\n12. seal and full-trailer truck\n13. loader and school bus\n14. mutt and bee\n15. mutt and Labrador\n16. motorcycle and pig\n17. box truck and Dalmatian\n18. pig and toucan\n19. red bell pepper and bear\n20. terrier and semi-trailer truck\n21. box truck and cat\n22. bear and school bus\n23. yellow bell pepper and basset hound\n24. chiller truck and Labrador\n25. semi-trailer truck and chiller truck\n26. pumpkin and Labrador\n27. tractor and chiller truck\n28. mutt and semi-trailer truck\n29. green bell pepper and toucan\n30. seal and Labrador\n31. green bell pepper and bear\n32. basset hound and car\n33. bee and cat\n34. Dalmatian and Labrador\n35. green bell pepper and potato\n36. chiller truck and cat\n37. green bell pepper and crane\n38. full-trailer truck and mutt\n39. full-trailer truck and red bell pepper\n40. chiller truck and onion\n41. motorcycle and chiller truck\n42. cat and eggplant\n43. red bell pepper and onion\n44. crane and motorcycle\n45. seal and cat\n46. crane and red bell pepper\n47. Labrador and car\n48. motorcycle and pumpkin\n49. tractor and full-trailer truck\n50. crane and bee\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
