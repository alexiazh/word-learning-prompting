A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three purps:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. toucan\n3. pig\n\nNow pick out the other purps from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. car\n3. loader\n4. green bell pepper\n5. box truck\n6. basset hound\n7. cat\n8. carrot\n9. bee\n10. onion\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador\n13. crane\n14. full-trailer truck\n15. school bus\n16. seal\n17. chiller truck\n18. eggplant\n19. Dalmatian\n20. bear\n21. red bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. box truck and Labrador\n2. basset hound and chiller truck\n3. mutt and pig\n4. motorcycle and semi-trailer truck\n5. loader and cat\n6. motorcycle and red bell pepper\n7. red bell pepper and eggplant\n8. mutt and yellow bell pepper\n9. red bell pepper and carrot\n10. semi-trailer truck and chiller truck\n11. pumpkin and basset hound\n12. potato and school bus\n13. red bell pepper and toucan\n14. motorcycle and seal\n15. green bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n16. mutt and car\n17. tractor and pumpkin\n18. Dalmatian and mutt\n19. seal and basset hound\n20. motorcycle and yellow bell pepper\n21. box truck and cat\n22. box truck and pig\n23. pumpkin and yellow bell pepper\n24. Dalmatian and full-trailer truck\n25. box truck and yellow bell pepper\n26. basset hound and toucan\n27. box truck and toucan\n28. green bell pepper and seal\n29. basset hound and car\n30. crane and garbage truck\n31. seal and full-trailer truck\n32. mutt and motorcycle\n33. green bell pepper and eggplant\n34. crane and seal\n35. carrot and terrier\n36. school bus and full-trailer truck\n37. tractor and full-trailer truck\n38. mutt and semi-trailer truck\n39. basset hound and full-trailer truck\n40. basset hound and terrier\n41. Labrador and potato\n42. green bell pepper and terrier\n43. crane and motorcycle\n44. red bell pepper and cat\n45. garbage truck and yellow bell pepper\n46. pumpkin and school bus\n47. pig and carrot\n48. seal and pig\n49. garbage truck and car\n50. red bell pepper and terrier\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
