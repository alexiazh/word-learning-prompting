A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three purps:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. toucan\n3. pig\n\nNow pick out the other purps from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. car\n3. loader\n4. green bell pepper\n5. box truck\n6. basset hound\n7. cat\n8. carrot\n9. bee\n10. onion\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador\n13. crane\n14. full-trailer truck\n15. school bus\n16. seal\n17. chiller truck\n18. eggplant\n19. Dalmatian\n20. bear\n21. red bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. bear and school bus\n2. crane and Dalmatian\n3. seal and toucan\n4. potato and bee\n5. crane and terrier\n6. Dalmatian and Labrador\n7. onion and yellow bell pepper\n8. garbage truck and full-trailer truck\n9. school bus and yellow bell pepper\n10. yellow bell pepper and terrier\n11. mutt and terrier\n12. bee and eggplant\n13. garbage truck and onion\n14. seal and car\n15. tractor and yellow bell pepper\n16. green bell pepper and onion\n17. green bell pepper and carrot\n18. garbage truck and motorcycle\n19. seal and carrot\n20. red bell pepper and car\n21. bear and full-trailer truck\n22. tractor and garbage truck\n23. red bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n24. cat and pig\n25. loader and potato\n26. mutt and garbage truck\n27. onion and terrier\n28. crane and school bus\n29. Labrador and seal\n30. cat and carrot\n31. motorcycle and car\n32. cat and school bus\n33. mutt and school bus\n34. eggplant and chiller truck\n35. pig and toucan\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
