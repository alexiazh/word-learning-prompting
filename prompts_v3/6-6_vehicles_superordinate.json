A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. school bus\n2. pumpkin\n3. bear\n4. cat\n5. Labrador\n6. carrot\n7. green bell pepper\n8. onion\n9. bee\n10. box truck\n11. crane\n12. car\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. Dalmatian\n16. basset hound\n17. seal\n18. eggplant\n19. full-trailer truck\n20. red bell pepper\n21. loader\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. bee and yellow bell pepper\n2. school bus and toucan\n3. seal and cat\n4. cat and motorcycle\n5. terrier and red bell pepper\n6. pumpkin and red bell pepper\n7. eggplant and carrot\n8. seal and box truck\n9. bear and basset hound\n10. terrier and mutt\n11. car and motorcycle\n12. mutt and bee\n13. tractor and crane\n14. motorcycle and Dalmatian\n15. semi-trailer truck and carrot\n16. seal and carrot\n17. pumpkin and full-trailer truck\n18. green bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n19. eggplant and potato\n20. loader and semi-trailer truck\n21. potato and bee\n22. chiller truck and cat\n23. seal and potato\n24. onion and Labrador\n25. potato and garbage truck\n26. car and pig\n27. eggplant and crane\n28. potato and basset hound\n29. green bell pepper and box truck\n30. terrier and eggplant\n31. bee and full-trailer truck\n32. bear and toucan\n33. crane and bear\n34. semi-trailer truck and toucan\n35. seal and bee\n36. bear and onion\n37. chiller truck and full-trailer truck\n38. seal and toucan\n39. chiller truck and box truck\n40. garbage truck and pumpkin\n41. terrier and pig\n42. box truck and full-trailer truck\n43. bee and pig\n44. full-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n45. yellow bell pepper and basset hound\n46. seal and basset hound\n47. garbage truck and red bell pepper\n48. yellow bell pepper and crane\n49. green bell pepper and carrot\n50. semi-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
