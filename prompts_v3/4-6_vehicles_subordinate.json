A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a lig:\n1. box truck\n\nNow pick out the other ligs from the following list:\n1. car\n2. full-trailer truck\n3. Labrador\n4. box truck\n5. carrot\n6. bee\n7. green bell pepper\n8. bear\n9. basset hound\n10. red bell pepper\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. cat\n13. pumpkin\n14. onion\n15. loader\n16. school bus\n17. Dalmatian\n18. eggplant\n19. chiller truck\n20. seal\n21. crane\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. semi-trailer truck and toucan\n2. potato and Labrador\n3. tractor and motorcycle\n4. box truck and terrier\n5. garbage truck and full-trailer truck\n6. green bell pepper and Labrador\n7. school bus and seal\n8. yellow bell pepper and pig\n9. school bus and Labrador\n10. Labrador and pig\n11. bear and carrot\n12. potato and mutt\n13. cat and garbage truck\n14. cat and red bell pepper\n15. potato and Dalmatian\n16. carrot and Dalmatian\n17. pumpkin and Dalmatian\n18. bear and tractor\n19. potato and full-trailer truck\n20. motorcycle and Labrador\n21. basset hound and crane\n22. terrier and mutt\n23. seal and full-trailer truck\n24. potato and eggplant\n25. school bus and basset hound\n26. pumpkin and tractor\n27. full-trailer truck and mutt\n28. pumpkin and yellow bell pepper\n29. pumpkin and pig\n30. pumpkin and onion\n31. semi-trailer truck and box truck\n32. potato and red bell pepper\n33. loader and tractor\n34. car and seal\n35. green bell pepper and bear\n36. semi-trailer truck and eggplant\n37. onion and mutt\n38. semi-trailer truck and loader\n39. potato and onion\n40. carrot and mutt\n41. garbage truck and red bell pepper\n42. onion and eggplant\n43. car and terrier\n44. garbage truck and motorcycle\n45. loader and eggplant\n46. basset hound and mutt\n47. carrot and toucan\n48. crane and bee\n49. bear and car\n50. onion and full-trailer truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
