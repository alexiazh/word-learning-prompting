A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three shars:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. potato\n3. eggplant\n\nNow pick out the other shars from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. bee\n3. green bell pepper\n4. crane\n5. basset hound\n6. full-trailer truck\n7. Labrador\n8. eggplant\n9. yellow bell pepper\n10. bear\n11. loader\n12. car\n13. box truck\n14. school bus\n15. carrot\n16. red bell pepper\n17. onion\n18. cat\n19. chiller truck\n20. Dalmatian\n21. seal\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. car and carrot\n2. mutt and green bell pepper\n3. onion and carrot\n4. loader and terrier\n5. bee and chiller truck\n6. seal and onion\n7. tractor and mutt\n8. pig and green bell pepper\n9. garbage truck and box truck\n10. full-trailer truck and bear\n11. school bus and terrier\n12. bear and carrot\n13. bee and potato\n14. motorcycle and potato\n15. terrier and toucan\n16. eggplant and crane\n17. Labrador and green bell pepper\n18. tractor and onion\n19. crane and toucan\n20. garbage truck and full-trailer truck\n21. bear and crane\n22. onion and potato\n23. box truck and toucan\n24. full-trailer truck and bee\n25. pumpkin and Dalmatian\n26. full-trailer truck and chiller truck\n27. red bell pepper and school bus\n28. bee and yellow bell pepper\n29. basset hound and yellow bell pepper\n30. full-trailer truck and Labrador\n31. school bus and basset hound\n32. loader and pig\n33. eggplant and car\n34. pumpkin and car\n35. pumpkin and bee\n36. onion and green bell pepper\n37. semi-trailer truck and Labrador\n38. eggplant and Dalmatian\n39. eggplant and toucan\n40. pumpkin and potato\n41. cat and green bell pepper\n42. seal and bear\n43. mutt and chiller truck\n44. garbage truck and bee\n45. potato and crane\n46. crane and carrot\n47. basset hound and box truck\n48. school bus and crane\n49. bee and bear\n50. full-trailer truck and cat\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
