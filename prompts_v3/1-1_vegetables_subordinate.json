A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a fep:\n1. green bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other feps from the following list:\n1. crane\n2. red bell pepper\n3. seal\n4. onion\n5. Labrador\n6. chiller truck\n7. yellow bell pepper\n8. pumpkin\n9. box truck\n10. cat\n11. car\n12. basset hound\n13. bear\n14. Dalmatian\n15. green bell pepper\n16. eggplant\n17. bee\n18. full-trailer truck\n19. carrot\n20. loader\n21. school bus\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. eggplant and school bus\n2. cat and chiller truck\n3. seal and Labrador\n4. tractor and chiller truck\n5. garbage truck and full-trailer truck\n6. toucan and semi-trailer truck\n7. loader and school bus\n8. potato and red bell pepper\n9. crane and mutt\n10. semi-trailer truck and school bus\n11. Dalmatian and yellow bell pepper\n12. terrier and yellow bell pepper\n13. green bell pepper and pig\n14. crane and carrot\n15. potato and school bus\n16. garbage truck and pig\n17. potato and box truck\n18. red bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n19. crane and tractor\n20. school bus and Labrador\n21. green bell pepper and school bus\n22. tractor and toucan\n23. garbage truck and semi-trailer truck\n24. semi-trailer truck and full-trailer truck\n25. chiller truck and yellow bell pepper\n26. loader and bear\n27. onion and school bus\n28. bear and semi-trailer truck\n29. green bell pepper and eggplant\n30. crane and potato\n31. bear and tractor\n32. pumpkin and motorcycle\n33. box truck and red bell pepper\n34. cat and red bell pepper\n35. toucan and car\n36. toucan and full-trailer truck\n37. cat and crane\n38. crane and seal\n39. cat and green bell pepper\n40. eggplant and box truck\n41. Dalmatian and motorcycle\n42. bear and chiller truck\n43. pumpkin and green bell pepper\n44. pig and yellow bell pepper\n45. onion and seal\n46. onion and pig\n47. basset hound and carrot\n48. green bell pepper and garbage truck\n49. bee and chiller truck\n50. carrot and full-trailer truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
