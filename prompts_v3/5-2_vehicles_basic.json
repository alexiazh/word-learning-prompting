A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three staws:\n1. box truck\n2. semi-trailer truck\n3. garbage truck\n\nNow pick out the other staws from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. Dalmatian\n3. seal\n4. box truck\n5. crane\n6. eggplant\n7. bear\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. full-trailer truck\n10. cat\n11. loader\n12. Labrador\n13. bee\n14. onion\n15. red bell pepper\n16. pumpkin\n17. school bus\n18. chiller truck\n19. green bell pepper\n20. basset hound\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. terrier and red bell pepper\n2. green bell pepper and Labrador\n3. full-trailer truck and box truck\n4. potato and school bus\n5. bear and loader\n6. eggplant and garbage truck\n7. semi-trailer truck and pumpkin\n8. chiller truck and tractor\n9. semi-trailer truck and onion\n10. toucan and yellow bell pepper\n11. seal and tractor\n12. loader and Labrador\n13. semi-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n14. yellow bell pepper and chiller truck\n15. cat and mutt\n16. onion and pig\n17. pumpkin and Labrador\n18. Labrador and basset hound\n19. full-trailer truck and eggplant\n20. mutt and loader\n21. seal and loader\n22. toucan and bee\n23. potato and bear\n24. school bus and chiller truck\n25. motorcycle and onion\n26. full-trailer truck and terrier\n27. bee and onion\n28. onion and garbage truck\n29. school bus and loader\n30. toucan and green bell pepper\n31. mutt and pumpkin\n32. semi-trailer truck and eggplant\n33. full-trailer truck and bee\n34. crane and school bus\n35. seal and Labrador\n36. seal and onion\n37. bear and garbage truck\n38. mutt and car\n39. eggplant and tractor\n40. potato and loader\n41. potato and toucan\n42. potato and semi-trailer truck\n43. full-trailer truck and toucan\n44. motorcycle and toucan\n45. eggplant and loader\n46. car and pig\n47. potato and basset hound\n48. toucan and loader\n49. terrier and toucan\n50. loader and green bell pepper\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
