A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three deeks:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. mutt\n3. terrier\n\nNow pick out the other deeks from the following list:\n1. bear\n2. chiller truck\n3. yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck\n5. basset hound\n6. seal\n7. carrot\n8. car\n9. onion\n10. crane\n11. pumpkin\n12. red bell pepper\n13. school bus\n14. bee\n15. Dalmatian\n16. Labrador\n17. cat\n18. eggplant\n19. loader\n20. box truck\n21. green bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. tractor and Dalmatian\n2. chiller truck and toucan\n3. basset hound and loader\n4. onion and car\n5. tractor and potato\n6. mutt and basset hound\n7. box truck and basset hound\n8. green bell pepper and onion\n9. chiller truck and bear\n10. box truck and red bell pepper\n11. pumpkin and bear\n12. Labrador and carrot\n13. Dalmatian and school bus\n14. full-trailer truck and Labrador\n15. seal and mutt\n16. pig and carrot\n17. crane and loader\n18. bee and potato\n19. motorcycle and toucan\n20. carrot and eggplant\n21. bee and car\n22. Labrador and eggplant\n23. carrot and car\n24. motorcycle and red bell pepper\n25. motorcycle and Dalmatian\n26. mutt and red bell pepper\n27. Dalmatian and potato\n28. garbage truck and bear\n29. Dalmatian and semi-trailer truck\n30. garbage truck and car\n31. tractor and cat\n32. green bell pepper and box truck\n33. tractor and toucan\n34. bee and red bell pepper\n35. pumpkin and school bus\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
