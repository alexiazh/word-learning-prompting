A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a fep:\n1. green bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other feps from the following list:\n1. crane\n2. red bell pepper\n3. seal\n4. onion\n5. Labrador\n6. chiller truck\n7. yellow bell pepper\n8. pumpkin\n9. box truck\n10. cat\n11. car\n12. basset hound\n13. bear\n14. Dalmatian\n15. green bell pepper\n16. eggplant\n17. bee\n18. full-trailer truck\n19. carrot\n20. loader\n21. school bus\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. tractor and terrier\n2. bear and potato\n3. basset hound and red bell pepper\n4. tractor and Labrador\n5. loader and car\n6. tractor and mutt\n7. toucan and pig\n8. green bell pepper and Labrador\n9. carrot and car\n10. loader and carrot\n11. cat and semi-trailer truck\n12. pumpkin and basset hound\n13. pig and full-trailer truck\n14. bee and school bus\n15. bee and terrier\n16. pumpkin and school bus\n17. onion and potato\n18. garbage truck and box truck\n19. Dalmatian and eggplant\n20. Dalmatian and basset hound\n21. loader and eggplant\n22. crane and toucan\n23. garbage truck and toucan\n24. toucan and motorcycle\n25. cat and eggplant\n26. toucan and box truck\n27. crane and bee\n28. crane and full-trailer truck\n29. motorcycle and chiller truck\n30. green bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n31. crane and onion\n32. tractor and carrot\n33. bear and toucan\n34. semi-trailer truck and Labrador\n35. pumpkin and potato\n36. garbage truck and basset hound\n37. seal and basset hound\n38. cat and terrier\n39. cat and motorcycle\n40. garbage truck and carrot\n41. basset hound and chiller truck\n42. pig and mutt\n43. carrot and Labrador\n44. pumpkin and garbage truck\n45. basset hound and Labrador\n46. green bell pepper and bear\n47. terrier and basset hound\n48. full-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n49. seal and full-trailer truck\n50. toucan and eggplant\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
