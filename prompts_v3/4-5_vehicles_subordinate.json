A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a lig:\n1. box truck\n\nNow pick out the other ligs from the following list:\n1. car\n2. full-trailer truck\n3. Labrador\n4. box truck\n5. carrot\n6. bee\n7. green bell pepper\n8. bear\n9. basset hound\n10. red bell pepper\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. cat\n13. pumpkin\n14. onion\n15. loader\n16. school bus\n17. Dalmatian\n18. eggplant\n19. chiller truck\n20. seal\n21. crane\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. mutt and bee\n2. semi-trailer truck and crane\n3. potato and basset hound\n4. semi-trailer truck and tractor\n5. school bus and semi-trailer truck\n6. box truck and motorcycle\n7. tractor and Labrador\n8. school bus and bee\n9. school bus and chiller truck\n10. semi-trailer truck and onion\n11. seal and pig\n12. onion and terrier\n13. yellow bell pepper and motorcycle\n14. tractor and toucan\n15. eggplant and Labrador\n16. car and pig\n17. yellow bell pepper and red bell pepper\n18. bear and crane\n19. chiller truck and terrier\n20. crane and motorcycle\n21. red bell pepper and mutt\n22. motorcycle and full-trailer truck\n23. pumpkin and bee\n24. terrier and bee\n25. cat and mutt\n26. seal and garbage truck\n27. school bus and potato\n28. basset hound and Labrador\n29. seal and Labrador\n30. chiller truck and box truck\n31. chiller truck and Labrador\n32. box truck and mutt\n33. bear and pig\n34. onion and garbage truck\n35. red bell pepper and motorcycle\n36. crane and full-trailer truck\n37. onion and motorcycle\n38. carrot and Labrador\n39. car and garbage truck\n40. semi-trailer truck and car\n41. green bell pepper and cat\n42. basset hound and bee\n43. red bell pepper and tractor\n44. pumpkin and seal\n45. onion and seal\n46. school bus and crane\n47. full-trailer truck and pig\n48. pumpkin and motorcycle\n49. car and chiller truck\n50. loader and carrot\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
