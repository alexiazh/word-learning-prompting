A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. school bus\n2. pumpkin\n3. bear\n4. cat\n5. Labrador\n6. carrot\n7. green bell pepper\n8. onion\n9. bee\n10. box truck\n11. crane\n12. car\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. Dalmatian\n16. basset hound\n17. seal\n18. eggplant\n19. full-trailer truck\n20. red bell pepper\n21. loader\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. bee and basset hound\n2. crane and motorcycle\n3. carrot and Labrador\n4. mutt and garbage truck\n5. garbage truck and motorcycle\n6. toucan and onion\n7. mutt and onion\n8. car and Labrador\n9. car and basset hound\n10. seal and onion\n11. terrier and chiller truck\n12. mutt and car\n13. pig and full-trailer truck\n14. yellow bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n15. mutt and school bus\n16. garbage truck and crane\n17. garbage truck and car\n18. garbage truck and bear\n19. mutt and full-trailer truck\n20. basset hound and toucan\n21. mutt and pumpkin\n22. pig and box truck\n23. bear and full-trailer truck\n24. mutt and semi-trailer truck\n25. pumpkin and pig\n26. semi-trailer truck and full-trailer truck\n27. semi-trailer truck and Labrador\n28. school bus and full-trailer truck\n29. garbage truck and tractor\n30. chiller truck and yellow bell pepper\n31. bee and onion\n32. eggplant and Dalmatian\n33. motorcycle and basset hound\n34. pumpkin and crane\n35. motorcycle and red bell pepper\n36. green bell pepper and motorcycle\n37. chiller truck and pig\n38. yellow bell pepper and box truck\n39. chiller truck and onion\n40. terrier and car\n41. basset hound and pig\n42. seal and mutt\n43. chiller truck and potato\n44. cat and bee\n45. tractor and motorcycle\n46. pumpkin and Labrador\n47. carrot and crane\n48. green bell pepper and school bus\n49. basset hound and Dalmatian\n50. cat and full-trailer truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
