A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three shars:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. potato\n3. eggplant\n\nNow pick out the other shars from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. bee\n3. green bell pepper\n4. crane\n5. basset hound\n6. full-trailer truck\n7. Labrador\n8. eggplant\n9. yellow bell pepper\n10. bear\n11. loader\n12. car\n13. box truck\n14. school bus\n15. carrot\n16. red bell pepper\n17. onion\n18. cat\n19. chiller truck\n20. Dalmatian\n21. seal\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. potato and carrot\n2. full-trailer truck and onion\n3. garbage truck and chiller truck\n4. Labrador and chiller truck\n5. loader and basset hound\n6. mutt and pig\n7. loader and potato\n8. garbage truck and toucan\n9. garbage truck and potato\n10. pumpkin and pig\n11. semi-trailer truck and bee\n12. garbage truck and semi-trailer truck\n13. basset hound and chiller truck\n14. full-trailer truck and school bus\n15. mutt and potato\n16. full-trailer truck and carrot\n17. red bell pepper and chiller truck\n18. motorcycle and Dalmatian\n19. bear and school bus\n20. onion and school bus\n21. eggplant and onion\n22. Dalmatian and terrier\n23. pumpkin and eggplant\n24. bear and cat\n25. yellow bell pepper and box truck\n26. seal and crane\n27. motorcycle and crane\n28. Dalmatian and potato\n29. bee and loader\n30. eggplant and potato\n31. bee and crane\n32. cat and toucan\n33. bee and Dalmatian\n34. Labrador and terrier\n35. loader and green bell pepper\n36. red bell pepper and basset hound\n37. full-trailer truck and terrier\n38. onion and terrier\n39. red bell pepper and Dalmatian\n40. bee and terrier\n41. cat and Labrador\n42. eggplant and chiller truck\n43. loader and car\n44. motorcycle and car\n45. semi-trailer truck and bear\n46. garbage truck and pig\n47. full-trailer truck and mutt\n48. bee and school bus\n49. pumpkin and full-trailer truck\n50. motorcycle and green bell pepper\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
