A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three staws:\n1. box truck\n2. semi-trailer truck\n3. garbage truck\n\nNow pick out the other staws from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. Dalmatian\n3. seal\n4. box truck\n5. crane\n6. eggplant\n7. bear\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. full-trailer truck\n10. cat\n11. loader\n12. Labrador\n13. bee\n14. onion\n15. red bell pepper\n16. pumpkin\n17. school bus\n18. chiller truck\n19. green bell pepper\n20. basset hound\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. car and garbage truck\n2. mutt and crane\n3. red bell pepper and Dalmatian\n4. semi-trailer truck and bee\n5. box truck and school bus\n6. car and chiller truck\n7. potato and yellow bell pepper\n8. car and yellow bell pepper\n9. green bell pepper and Dalmatian\n10. seal and pig\n11. green bell pepper and pumpkin\n12. toucan and pumpkin\n13. bear and carrot\n14. pumpkin and tractor\n15. mutt and red bell pepper\n16. cat and motorcycle\n17. bear and basset hound\n18. mutt and seal\n19. pumpkin and chiller truck\n20. toucan and tractor\n21. full-trailer truck and chiller truck\n22. yellow bell pepper and tractor\n23. loader and pumpkin\n24. mutt and terrier\n25. loader and chiller truck\n26. semi-trailer truck and car\n27. toucan and red bell pepper\n28. motorcycle and car\n29. terrier and carrot\n30. potato and Dalmatian\n31. onion and basset hound\n32. semi-trailer truck and green bell pepper\n33. seal and carrot\n34. terrier and school bus\n35. yellow bell pepper and green bell pepper\n36. terrier and Labrador\n37. terrier and garbage truck\n38. box truck and red bell pepper\n39. terrier and onion\n40. potato and crane\n41. Labrador and Dalmatian\n42. motorcycle and bee\n43. mutt and bee\n44. school bus and Dalmatian\n45. bee and tractor\n46. car and bee\n47. bee and eggplant\n48. car and pumpkin\n49. terrier and loader\n50. bear and chiller truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
