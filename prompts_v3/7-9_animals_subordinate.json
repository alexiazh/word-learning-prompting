    "prompt_to_run": "You will be given a task consisting of two parts:\n1. A word-learning phase where you will be shown examples of a new word and give a similarity score of the word.\n2. A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a bub:\n1. Dalmatian\n\nNow pick out the other bubs from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. bee\n3. onion\n4. loader\n5. green bell pepper\n6. eggplant\n7. basset hound\n8. Labrador\n9. cat\n10. red bell pepper\n11. box truck\n12. bear\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. school bus\n16. car\n17. seal\n18. pumpkin\n19. crane\n20. Dalmatian\n21. full-trailer truck\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. pig and basset hound\n2. motorcycle and carrot\n3. chiller truck and pumpkin\n4. motorcycle and pumpkin\n5. eggplant and carrot\n6. chiller truck and cat\n7. crane and yellow bell pepper\n8. potato and crane\n9. chiller truck and onion\n10. red bell pepper and school bus\n11. bee and loader\n12. bee and seal\n13. toucan and pumpkin\n14. semi-trailer truck and seal\n15. toucan and potato\n16. potato and loader\n17. potato and onion\n18. school bus and yellow bell pepper\n19. red bell pepper and onion\n20. semi-trailer truck and box truck\n21. Dalmatian and tractor\n22. pig and motorcycle\n23. car and cat\n24. pig and car\n25. carrot and mutt\n26. tractor and bear\n27. potato and bear\n28. green bell pepper and loader\n29. mutt and tractor\n30. motorcycle and Dalmatian\n31. motorcycle and basset hound\n32. Labrador and yellow bell pepper\n33. eggplant and terrier\n34. yellow bell pepper and box truck\n35. loader and yellow bell pepper\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
