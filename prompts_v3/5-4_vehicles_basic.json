A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three staws:\n1. box truck\n2. semi-trailer truck\n3. garbage truck\n\nNow pick out the other staws from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. Dalmatian\n3. seal\n4. box truck\n5. crane\n6. eggplant\n7. bear\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. full-trailer truck\n10. cat\n11. loader\n12. Labrador\n13. bee\n14. onion\n15. red bell pepper\n16. pumpkin\n17. school bus\n18. chiller truck\n19. green bell pepper\n20. basset hound\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. school bus and Labrador\n2. mutt and chiller truck\n3. cat and red bell pepper\n4. bear and box truck\n5. red bell pepper and green bell pepper\n6. semi-trailer truck and terrier\n7. full-trailer truck and Labrador\n8. potato and eggplant\n9. car and tractor\n10. bee and carrot\n11. mutt and full-trailer truck\n12. semi-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n13. garbage truck and pig\n14. cat and loader\n15. box truck and crane\n16. eggplant and green bell pepper\n17. terrier and crane\n18. yellow bell pepper and eggplant\n19. mutt and yellow bell pepper\n20. basset hound and pig\n21. toucan and chiller truck\n22. terrier and car\n23. school bus and garbage truck\n24. motorcycle and crane\n25. loader and tractor\n26. full-trailer truck and crane\n27. box truck and basset hound\n28. box truck and Dalmatian\n29. box truck and Labrador\n30. car and school bus\n31. cat and car\n32. box truck and onion\n33. bee and yellow bell pepper\n34. terrier and chiller truck\n35. semi-trailer truck and basset hound\n36. potato and box truck\n37. terrier and bee\n38. garbage truck and tractor\n39. full-trailer truck and green bell pepper\n40. yellow bell pepper and garbage truck\n41. potato and Labrador\n42. carrot and Labrador\n43. box truck and pumpkin\n44. onion and loader\n45. full-trailer truck and carrot\n46. box truck and toucan\n47. crane and red bell pepper\n48. potato and chiller truck\n49. cat and school bus\n50. cat and crane\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
