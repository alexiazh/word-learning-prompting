A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a lig:\n1. box truck\n\nNow pick out the other ligs from the following list:\n1. car\n2. full-trailer truck\n3. Labrador\n4. box truck\n5. carrot\n6. bee\n7. green bell pepper\n8. bear\n9. basset hound\n10. red bell pepper\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. cat\n13. pumpkin\n14. onion\n15. loader\n16. school bus\n17. Dalmatian\n18. eggplant\n19. chiller truck\n20. seal\n21. crane\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. potato and crane\n2. green bell pepper and onion\n3. car and Labrador\n4. seal and box truck\n5. crane and loader\n6. basset hound and motorcycle\n7. Dalmatian and box truck\n8. green bell pepper and mutt\n9. semi-trailer truck and mutt\n10. car and tractor\n11. box truck and pig\n12. bear and eggplant\n13. loader and terrier\n14. bear and red bell pepper\n15. school bus and tractor\n16. chiller truck and yellow bell pepper\n17. loader and motorcycle\n18. green bell pepper and red bell pepper\n19. garbage truck and Labrador\n20. Dalmatian and eggplant\n21. carrot and full-trailer truck\n22. semi-trailer truck and garbage truck\n23. pig and bee\n24. school bus and cat\n25. seal and yellow bell pepper\n26. cat and box truck\n27. seal and basset hound\n28. seal and loader\n29. chiller truck and eggplant\n30. chiller truck and garbage truck\n31. bear and Dalmatian\n32. eggplant and motorcycle\n33. school bus and Dalmatian\n34. semi-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n35. basset hound and chiller truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
