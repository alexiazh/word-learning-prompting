A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a bub:\n1. Dalmatian\n\nNow pick out the other bubs from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. bee\n3. onion\n4. loader\n5. green bell pepper\n6. eggplant\n7. basset hound\n8. Labrador\n9. cat\n10. red bell pepper\n11. box truck\n12. bear\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. school bus\n16. car\n17. seal\n18. pumpkin\n19. crane\n20. Dalmatian\n21. full-trailer truck\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. cat and seal\n2. pig and cat\n3. basset hound and mutt\n4. chiller truck and box truck\n5. Labrador and carrot\n6. green bell pepper and box truck\n7. eggplant and mutt\n8. terrier and loader\n9. bee and bear\n10. chiller truck and crane\n11. green bell pepper and car\n12. cat and yellow bell pepper\n13. pig and loader\n14. bee and terrier\n15. eggplant and tractor\n16. school bus and mutt\n17. terrier and box truck\n18. full-trailer truck and semi-trailer truck\n19. terrier and garbage truck\n20. garbage truck and box truck\n21. full-trailer truck and toucan\n22. car and Labrador\n23. chiller truck and full-trailer truck\n24. Labrador and crane\n25. green bell pepper and cat\n26. motorcycle and terrier\n27. motorcycle and potato\n28. chiller truck and toucan\n29. Dalmatian and red bell pepper\n30. terrier and bear\n31. terrier and seal\n32. green bell pepper and potato\n33. Labrador and school bus\n34. pumpkin and onion\n35. motorcycle and Labrador\n36. basset hound and loader\n37. basset hound and school bus\n38. pumpkin and bear\n39. motorcycle and bear\n40. terrier and yellow bell pepper\n41. car and terrier\n42. box truck and onion\n43. toucan and loader\n44. carrot and seal\n45. loader and crane\n46. Labrador and eggplant\n47. Labrador and basset hound\n48. semi-trailer truck and onion\n49. pumpkin and school bus\n50. pumpkin and box truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
