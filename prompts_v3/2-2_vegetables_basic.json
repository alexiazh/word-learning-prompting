A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three koots:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. red bell pepper\n3. yellow bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other koots from the following list:\n1. box truck\n2. red bell pepper\n3. bee\n4. crane\n5. bear\n6. onion\n7. seal\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. cat\n10. green bell pepper\n11. basset hound\n12. full-trailer truck\n13. carrot\n14. pumpkin\n15. chiller truck\n16. eggplant\n17. Labrador\n18. school bus\n19. loader\n20. Dalmatian\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. pig and Labrador\n2. yellow bell pepper and bear\n3. car and full-trailer truck\n4. chiller truck and mutt\n5. semi-trailer truck and mutt\n6. red bell pepper and bee\n7. Dalmatian and school bus\n8. full-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n9. Dalmatian and green bell pepper\n10. eggplant and tractor\n11. bee and motorcycle\n12. toucan and bear\n13. car and tractor\n14. eggplant and motorcycle\n15. potato and garbage truck\n16. mutt and garbage truck\n17. onion and mutt\n18. basset hound and crane\n19. box truck and basset hound\n20. tractor and motorcycle\n21. toucan and school bus\n22. box truck and eggplant\n23. pumpkin and bear\n24. box truck and garbage truck\n25. full-trailer truck and pig\n26. terrier and bee\n27. full-trailer truck and pumpkin\n28. potato and loader\n29. toucan and Labrador\n30. seal and mutt\n31. bee and garbage truck\n32. car and seal\n33. red bell pepper and pig\n34. tractor and cat\n35. terrier and tractor\n36. seal and Labrador\n37. Labrador and mutt\n38. Dalmatian and motorcycle\n39. pig and loader\n40. potato and semi-trailer truck\n41. pumpkin and garbage truck\n42. onion and Labrador\n43. potato and pumpkin\n44. green bell pepper and Labrador\n45. toucan and chiller truck\n46. full-trailer truck and loader\n47. carrot and school bus\n48. potato and chiller truck\n49. red bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n50. box truck and crane\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
