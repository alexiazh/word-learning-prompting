A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three deeks:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. mutt\n3. terrier\n\nNow pick out the other deeks from the following list:\n1. bear\n2. chiller truck\n3. yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck\n5. basset hound\n6. seal\n7. carrot\n8. car\n9. onion\n10. crane\n11. pumpkin\n12. red bell pepper\n13. school bus\n14. bee\n15. Dalmatian\n16. Labrador\n17. cat\n18. eggplant\n19. loader\n20. box truck\n21. green bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. box truck and pig\n2. seal and carrot\n3. potato and eggplant\n4. mutt and car\n5. green bell pepper and pig\n6. bear and toucan\n7. bee and chiller truck\n8. school bus and carrot\n9. garbage truck and terrier\n10. red bell pepper and cat\n11. crane and Labrador\n12. mutt and chiller truck\n13. Dalmatian and pig\n14. tractor and motorcycle\n15. bear and onion\n16. box truck and Labrador\n17. terrier and bear\n18. pumpkin and bee\n19. full-trailer truck and basset hound\n20. bear and carrot\n21. seal and eggplant\n22. terrier and toucan\n23. motorcycle and semi-trailer truck\n24. pig and chiller truck\n25. tractor and onion\n26. pumpkin and loader\n27. basset hound and Labrador\n28. Dalmatian and eggplant\n29. garbage truck and onion\n30. full-trailer truck and bee\n31. Dalmatian and pumpkin\n32. motorcycle and bee\n33. seal and toucan\n34. chiller truck and carrot\n35. green bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n36. seal and Dalmatian\n37. box truck and semi-trailer truck\n38. mutt and pumpkin\n39. garbage truck and basset hound\n40. garbage truck and potato\n41. crane and box truck\n42. cat and school bus\n43. full-trailer truck and terrier\n44. pumpkin and car\n45. tractor and carrot\n46. semi-trailer truck and Labrador\n47. tractor and bee\n48. bee and school bus\n49. pig and basset hound\n50. loader and onion\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
