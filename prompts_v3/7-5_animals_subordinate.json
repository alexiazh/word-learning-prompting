    "prompt_to_run": "You will be given a task consisting of two parts:\n1. A word-learning phase where you will be shown examples of a new word and give a similarity score of the word.\n2. A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a bub:\n1. Dalmatian\n\nNow pick out the other bubs from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. bee\n3. onion\n4. loader\n5. green bell pepper\n6. eggplant\n7. basset hound\n8. Labrador\n9. cat\n10. red bell pepper\n11. box truck\n12. bear\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. school bus\n16. car\n17. seal\n18. pumpkin\n19. crane\n20. Dalmatian\n21. full-trailer truck\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. seal and onion\n2. toucan and tractor\n3. loader and school bus\n4. pig and bear\n5. toucan and semi-trailer truck\n6. potato and carrot\n7. carrot and bear\n8. chiller truck and car\n9. Labrador and onion\n10. bee and box truck\n11. semi-trailer truck and tractor\n12. crane and garbage truck\n13. Labrador and garbage truck\n14. crane and onion\n15. green bell pepper and tractor\n16. pig and red bell pepper\n17. basset hound and onion\n18. carrot and pumpkin\n19. eggplant and red bell pepper\n20. full-trailer truck and terrier\n21. motorcycle and green bell pepper\n22. chiller truck and Labrador\n23. pig and mutt\n24. full-trailer truck and Labrador\n25. red bell pepper and mutt\n26. car and school bus\n27. chiller truck and garbage truck\n28. basset hound and crane\n29. loader and box truck\n30. green bell pepper and garbage truck\n31. car and yellow bell pepper\n32. eggplant and semi-trailer truck\n33. pig and garbage truck\n34. cat and onion\n35. potato and mutt\n36. motorcycle and car\n37. eggplant and basset hound\n38. Dalmatian and garbage truck\n39. Dalmatian and bear\n40. carrot and garbage truck\n41. box truck and bear\n42. pig and seal\n43. bee and basset hound\n44. carrot and red bell pepper\n45. eggplant and loader\n46. full-trailer truck and box truck\n47. Labrador and pumpkin\n48. mutt and onion\n49. motorcycle and mutt\n50. semi-trailer truck and bear\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
