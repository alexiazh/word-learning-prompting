A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three staws:\n1. box truck\n2. semi-trailer truck\n3. garbage truck\n\nNow pick out the other staws from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. Dalmatian\n3. seal\n4. box truck\n5. crane\n6. eggplant\n7. bear\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. full-trailer truck\n10. cat\n11. loader\n12. Labrador\n13. bee\n14. onion\n15. red bell pepper\n16. pumpkin\n17. school bus\n18. chiller truck\n19. green bell pepper\n20. basset hound\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. onion and red bell pepper\n2. motorcycle and Dalmatian\n3. bee and pumpkin\n4. crane and eggplant\n5. cat and green bell pepper\n6. full-trailer truck and loader\n7. potato and pumpkin\n8. potato and onion\n9. semi-trailer truck and bear\n10. loader and garbage truck\n11. cat and toucan\n12. motorcycle and carrot\n13. toucan and pig\n14. eggplant and red bell pepper\n15. car and crane\n16. motorcycle and Labrador\n17. carrot and garbage truck\n18. eggplant and chiller truck\n19. cat and yellow bell pepper\n20. semi-trailer truck and toucan\n21. box truck and seal\n22. seal and school bus\n23. chiller truck and basset hound\n24. red bell pepper and pumpkin\n25. cat and semi-trailer truck\n26. potato and green bell pepper\n27. full-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n28. car and onion\n29. yellow bell pepper and loader\n30. yellow bell pepper and pig\n31. toucan and Labrador\n32. onion and Labrador\n33. motorcycle and green bell pepper\n34. garbage truck and Dalmatian\n35. bear and bee\n36. mutt and bear\n37. cat and seal\n38. terrier and seal\n39. cat and chiller truck\n40. mutt and tractor\n41. school bus and carrot\n42. cat and box truck\n43. cat and basset hound\n44. Labrador and pig\n45. green bell pepper and chiller truck\n46. car and green bell pepper\n47. crane and Labrador\n48. potato and pig\n49. crane and carrot\n50. bear and pumpkin\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
