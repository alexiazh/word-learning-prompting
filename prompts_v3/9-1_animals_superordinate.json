A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three purps:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. toucan\n3. pig\n\nNow pick out the other purps from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. car\n3. loader\n4. green bell pepper\n5. box truck\n6. basset hound\n7. cat\n8. carrot\n9. bee\n10. onion\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador\n13. crane\n14. full-trailer truck\n15. school bus\n16. seal\n17. chiller truck\n18. eggplant\n19. Dalmatian\n20. bear\n21. red bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. Dalmatian and tractor\n2. bear and potato\n3. tractor and toucan\n4. basset hound and yellow bell pepper\n5. tractor and bear\n6. onion and full-trailer truck\n7. bee and yellow bell pepper\n8. cat and toucan\n9. red bell pepper and basset hound\n10. basset hound and pig\n11. garbage truck and seal\n12. pig and semi-trailer truck\n13. car and yellow bell pepper\n14. motorcycle and eggplant\n15. tractor and carrot\n16. pig and school bus\n17. basset hound and eggplant\n18. potato and eggplant\n19. carrot and potato\n20. box truck and green bell pepper\n21. red bell pepper and bear\n22. onion and chiller truck\n23. potato and yellow bell pepper\n24. semi-trailer truck and toucan\n25. Labrador and carrot\n26. bear and car\n27. loader and semi-trailer truck\n28. Labrador and chiller truck\n29. seal and potato\n30. seal and yellow bell pepper\n31. box truck and pumpkin\n32. pig and car\n33. toucan and yellow bell pepper\n34. Dalmatian and motorcycle\n35. tractor and red bell pepper\n36. Labrador and cat\n37. basset hound and potato\n38. green bell pepper and bee\n39. Labrador and garbage truck\n40. cat and bear\n41. red bell pepper and school bus\n42. potato and terrier\n43. pumpkin and motorcycle\n44. pumpkin and chiller truck\n45. Labrador and semi-trailer truck\n46. pumpkin and pig\n47. Labrador and basset hound\n48. tractor and motorcycle\n49. green bell pepper and pig\n50. cat and car\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
