A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three purps:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. toucan\n3. pig\n\nNow pick out the other purps from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. car\n3. loader\n4. green bell pepper\n5. box truck\n6. basset hound\n7. cat\n8. carrot\n9. bee\n10. onion\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador\n13. crane\n14. full-trailer truck\n15. school bus\n16. seal\n17. chiller truck\n18. eggplant\n19. Dalmatian\n20. bear\n21. red bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. Labrador and mutt\n2. box truck and motorcycle\n3. pumpkin and semi-trailer truck\n4. Labrador and onion\n5. motorcycle and pig\n6. garbage truck and pumpkin\n7. eggplant and full-trailer truck\n8. crane and mutt\n9. chiller truck and terrier\n10. bear and bee\n11. motorcycle and terrier\n12. Dalmatian and pumpkin\n13. tractor and green bell pepper\n14. bee and terrier\n15. pig and chiller truck\n16. bee and onion\n17. loader and red bell pepper\n18. mutt and pumpkin\n19. garbage truck and cat\n20. box truck and car\n21. cat and terrier\n22. box truck and carrot\n23. garbage truck and toucan\n24. green bell pepper and basset hound\n25. bee and semi-trailer truck\n26. box truck and mutt\n27. box truck and basset hound\n28. garbage truck and red bell pepper\n29. loader and tractor\n30. Dalmatian and pig\n31. Dalmatian and garbage truck\n32. tractor and school bus\n33. bear and eggplant\n34. pig and bee\n35. carrot and bee\n36. red bell pepper and bee\n37. potato and chiller truck\n38. Dalmatian and toucan\n39. crane and car\n40. bear and semi-trailer truck\n41. green bell pepper and bear\n42. loader and bear\n43. Labrador and eggplant\n44. tractor and potato\n45. mutt and cat\n46. seal and eggplant\n47. box truck and eggplant\n48. crane and full-trailer truck\n49. green bell pepper and car\n50. box truck and semi-trailer truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
