A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three koots:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. red bell pepper\n3. yellow bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other koots from the following list:\n1. box truck\n2. red bell pepper\n3. bee\n4. crane\n5. bear\n6. onion\n7. seal\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. cat\n10. green bell pepper\n11. basset hound\n12. full-trailer truck\n13. carrot\n14. pumpkin\n15. chiller truck\n16. eggplant\n17. Labrador\n18. school bus\n19. loader\n20. Dalmatian\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. toucan and garbage truck\n2. yellow bell pepper and pumpkin\n3. eggplant and green bell pepper\n4. seal and green bell pepper\n5. potato and full-trailer truck\n6. pig and crane\n7. green bell pepper and cat\n8. tractor and school bus\n9. red bell pepper and box truck\n10. bee and seal\n11. bee and Dalmatian\n12. pig and mutt\n13. yellow bell pepper and toucan\n14. yellow bell pepper and green bell pepper\n15. full-trailer truck and garbage truck\n16. motorcycle and bear\n17. car and eggplant\n18. terrier and garbage truck\n19. seal and crane\n20. full-trailer truck and bear\n21. seal and school bus\n22. crane and school bus\n23. terrier and green bell pepper\n24. car and Dalmatian\n25. motorcycle and loader\n26. green bell pepper and mutt\n27. car and terrier\n28. potato and school bus\n29. loader and mutt\n30. semi-trailer truck and school bus\n31. terrier and Labrador\n32. red bell pepper and tractor\n33. tractor and loader\n34. eggplant and bee\n35. pig and chiller truck\n36. terrier and basset hound\n37. cat and bear\n38. bee and Labrador\n39. full-trailer truck and semi-trailer truck\n40. pumpkin and basset hound\n41. tractor and crane\n42. potato and mutt\n43. tractor and pumpkin\n44. bee and school bus\n45. green bell pepper and pig\n46. red bell pepper and carrot\n47. carrot and basset hound\n48. red bell pepper and pumpkin\n49. full-trailer truck and motorcycle\n50. carrot and crane\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
