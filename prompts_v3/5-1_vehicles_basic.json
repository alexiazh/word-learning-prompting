A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three staws:\n1. box truck\n2. semi-trailer truck\n3. garbage truck\n\nNow pick out the other staws from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. Dalmatian\n3. seal\n4. box truck\n5. crane\n6. eggplant\n7. bear\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. full-trailer truck\n10. cat\n11. loader\n12. Labrador\n13. bee\n14. onion\n15. red bell pepper\n16. pumpkin\n17. school bus\n18. chiller truck\n19. green bell pepper\n20. basset hound\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. motorcycle and bear\n2. red bell pepper and chiller truck\n3. carrot and red bell pepper\n4. terrier and eggplant\n5. cat and terrier\n6. motorcycle and seal\n7. semi-trailer truck and pig\n8. terrier and green bell pepper\n9. eggplant and pig\n10. carrot and eggplant\n11. onion and chiller truck\n12. school bus and yellow bell pepper\n13. Labrador and tractor\n14. semi-trailer truck and carrot\n15. semi-trailer truck and chiller truck\n16. crane and yellow bell pepper\n17. motorcycle and terrier\n18. onion and pumpkin\n19. cat and pumpkin\n20. carrot and chiller truck\n21. semi-trailer truck and box truck\n22. full-trailer truck and garbage truck\n23. eggplant and basset hound\n24. seal and red bell pepper\n25. red bell pepper and garbage truck\n26. bear and tractor\n27. school bus and pumpkin\n28. bee and pig\n29. cat and bear\n30. semi-trailer truck and school bus\n31. car and basset hound\n32. box truck and car\n33. motorcycle and semi-trailer truck\n34. potato and red bell pepper\n35. Dalmatian and tractor\n36. car and carrot\n37. loader and red bell pepper\n38. cat and bee\n39. seal and basset hound\n40. potato and car\n41. bear and toucan\n42. yellow bell pepper and red bell pepper\n43. school bus and eggplant\n44. box truck and chiller truck\n45. motorcycle and eggplant\n46. bear and pig\n47. seal and Dalmatian\n48. cat and onion\n49. pumpkin and pig\n50. bee and loader\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
