A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three deeks:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. mutt\n3. terrier\n\nNow pick out the other deeks from the following list:\n1. bear\n2. chiller truck\n3. yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck\n5. basset hound\n6. seal\n7. carrot\n8. car\n9. onion\n10. crane\n11. pumpkin\n12. red bell pepper\n13. school bus\n14. bee\n15. Dalmatian\n16. Labrador\n17. cat\n18. eggplant\n19. loader\n20. box truck\n21. green bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. loader and eggplant\n2. basset hound and chiller truck\n3. motorcycle and yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck and car\n5. crane and semi-trailer truck\n6. potato and toucan\n7. Dalmatian and cat\n8. cat and bear\n9. full-trailer truck and chiller truck\n10. Labrador and onion\n11. garbage truck and Labrador\n12. seal and bear\n13. crane and garbage truck\n14. tractor and yellow bell pepper\n15. green bell pepper and pumpkin\n16. pig and pumpkin\n17. school bus and car\n18. crane and pig\n19. cat and onion\n20. yellow bell pepper and loader\n21. tractor and school bus\n22. terrier and basset hound\n23. seal and bee\n24. green bell pepper and loader\n25. box truck and motorcycle\n26. crane and Dalmatian\n27. seal and semi-trailer truck\n28. crane and toucan\n29. basset hound and school bus\n30. tractor and seal\n31. box truck and school bus\n32. potato and onion\n33. semi-trailer truck and red bell pepper\n34. loader and red bell pepper\n35. full-trailer truck and pumpkin\n36. tractor and car\n37. yellow bell pepper and potato\n38. green bell pepper and yellow bell pepper\n39. garbage truck and bee\n40. basset hound and bee\n41. box truck and full-trailer truck\n42. box truck and chiller truck\n43. garbage truck and loader\n44. yellow bell pepper and bear\n45. box truck and bee\n46. terrier and yellow bell pepper\n47. Labrador and toucan\n48. green bell pepper and garbage truck\n49. box truck and potato\n50. terrier and eggplant\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
