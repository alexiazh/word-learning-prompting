A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a bub:\n1. Dalmatian\n\nNow pick out the other bubs from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. bee\n3. onion\n4. loader\n5. green bell pepper\n6. eggplant\n7. basset hound\n8. Labrador\n9. cat\n10. red bell pepper\n11. box truck\n12. bear\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. school bus\n16. car\n17. seal\n18. pumpkin\n19. crane\n20. Dalmatian\n21. full-trailer truck\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. red bell pepper and seal\n2. eggplant and school bus\n3. toucan and mutt\n4. bee and toucan\n5. Dalmatian and yellow bell pepper\n6. potato and pumpkin\n7. Labrador and bear\n8. full-trailer truck and potato\n9. terrier and school bus\n10. toucan and seal\n11. pig and full-trailer truck\n12. basset hound and pumpkin\n13. car and red bell pepper\n14. pig and green bell pepper\n15. full-trailer truck and basset hound\n16. terrier and tractor\n17. Dalmatian and terrier\n18. motorcycle and tractor\n19. mutt and bear\n20. carrot and semi-trailer truck\n21. chiller truck and semi-trailer truck\n22. pig and carrot\n23. cat and bear\n24. terrier and crane\n25. bee and mutt\n26. Labrador and toucan\n27. cat and loader\n28. pig and crane\n29. seal and bear\n30. green bell pepper and Labrador\n31. Dalmatian and toucan\n32. chiller truck and potato\n33. mutt and box truck\n34. Labrador and tractor\n35. carrot and yellow bell pepper\n36. toucan and basset hound\n37. full-trailer truck and seal\n38. crane and box truck\n39. potato and terrier\n40. seal and box truck\n41. Labrador and cat\n42. red bell pepper and loader\n43. crane and bear\n44. red bell pepper and tractor\n45. motorcycle and garbage truck\n46. car and mutt\n47. car and garbage truck\n48. cat and carrot\n49. potato and eggplant\n50. Dalmatian and mutt\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
