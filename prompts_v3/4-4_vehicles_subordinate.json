A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a lig:\n1. box truck\n\nNow pick out the other ligs from the following list:\n1. car\n2. full-trailer truck\n3. Labrador\n4. box truck\n5. carrot\n6. bee\n7. green bell pepper\n8. bear\n9. basset hound\n10. red bell pepper\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. cat\n13. pumpkin\n14. onion\n15. loader\n16. school bus\n17. Dalmatian\n18. eggplant\n19. chiller truck\n20. seal\n21. crane\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. yellow bell pepper and terrier\n2. seal and crane\n3. school bus and bear\n4. Labrador and bee\n5. garbage truck and terrier\n6. box truck and garbage truck\n7. green bell pepper and toucan\n8. green bell pepper and seal\n9. crane and Dalmatian\n10. yellow bell pepper and tractor\n11. seal and terrier\n12. seal and tractor\n13. loader and bee\n14. bear and bee\n15. yellow bell pepper and box truck\n16. tractor and terrier\n17. carrot and box truck\n18. cat and full-trailer truck\n19. green bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n20. seal and bee\n21. crane and Labrador\n22. bear and semi-trailer truck\n23. semi-trailer truck and pig\n24. basset hound and toucan\n25. onion and basset hound\n26. yellow bell pepper and Labrador\n27. chiller truck and mutt\n28. eggplant and bee\n29. Dalmatian and tractor\n30. potato and loader\n31. bear and onion\n32. school bus and toucan\n33. semi-trailer truck and terrier\n34. crane and yellow bell pepper\n35. red bell pepper and toucan\n36. bear and terrier\n37. crane and red bell pepper\n38. basset hound and red bell pepper\n39. onion and chiller truck\n40. cat and Dalmatian\n41. onion and Dalmatian\n42. garbage truck and mutt\n43. pumpkin and basset hound\n44. chiller truck and red bell pepper\n45. potato and bee\n46. Dalmatian and toucan\n47. seal and mutt\n48. motorcycle and pig\n49. Dalmatian and terrier\n50. yellow bell pepper and toucan\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
