    "prompt_to_run": "You will be given a task consisting of two parts:\n1. A word-learning phase where you will be shown examples of a new word and give a similarity score of the word.\n2. A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. school bus\n2. pumpkin\n3. bear\n4. cat\n5. Labrador\n6. carrot\n7. green bell pepper\n8. onion\n9. bee\n10. box truck\n11. crane\n12. car\n13. yellow bell pepper\n14. chiller truck\n15. Dalmatian\n16. basset hound\n17. seal\n18. eggplant\n19. full-trailer truck\n20. red bell pepper\n21. loader\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. potato and school bus\n2. cat and car\n3. terrier and tractor\n4. yellow bell pepper and motorcycle\n5. yellow bell pepper and pig\n6. garbage truck and basset hound\n7. mutt and potato\n8. loader and onion\n9. loader and tractor\n10. bee and carrot\n11. school bus and Labrador\n12. semi-trailer truck and pig\n13. chiller truck and crane\n14. terrier and box truck\n15. eggplant and box truck\n16. terrier and school bus\n17. mutt and cat\n18. carrot and onion\n19. potato and crane\n20. garbage truck and box truck\n21. bee and garbage truck\n22. pumpkin and bear\n23. mutt and basset hound\n24. tractor and Dalmatian\n25. green bell pepper and Labrador\n26. chiller truck and motorcycle\n27. crane and basset hound\n28. loader and Dalmatian\n29. loader and red bell pepper\n30. bee and bear\n31. eggplant and school bus\n32. potato and yellow bell pepper\n33. carrot and Dalmatian\n34. chiller truck and carrot\n35. mutt and yellow bell pepper\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
