A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a fep:\n1. green bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other feps from the following list:\n1. crane\n2. red bell pepper\n3. seal\n4. onion\n5. Labrador\n6. chiller truck\n7. yellow bell pepper\n8. pumpkin\n9. box truck\n10. cat\n11. car\n12. basset hound\n13. bear\n14. Dalmatian\n15. green bell pepper\n16. eggplant\n17. bee\n18. full-trailer truck\n19. carrot\n20. loader\n21. school bus\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. bee and box truck\n2. bear and seal\n3. loader and green bell pepper\n4. bear and box truck\n5. potato and mutt\n6. eggplant and basset hound\n7. crane and Labrador\n8. tractor and onion\n9. seal and car\n10. seal and yellow bell pepper\n11. bear and crane\n12. tractor and pig\n13. chiller truck and Labrador\n14. bee and motorcycle\n15. garbage truck and bee\n16. cat and pumpkin\n17. cat and garbage truck\n18. chiller truck and carrot\n19. seal and mutt\n20. tractor and seal\n21. bear and basset hound\n22. seal and potato\n23. eggplant and red bell pepper\n24. green bell pepper and box truck\n25. car and Labrador\n26. box truck and Labrador\n27. chiller truck and semi-trailer truck\n28. bear and motorcycle\n29. pig and semi-trailer truck\n30. terrier and mutt\n31. toucan and terrier\n32. loader and pig\n33. motorcycle and semi-trailer truck\n34. bear and garbage truck\n35. potato and chiller truck\n36. toucan and school bus\n37. motorcycle and carrot\n38. loader and red bell pepper\n39. red bell pepper and Labrador\n40. loader and yellow bell pepper\n41. loader and seal\n42. loader and box truck\n43. cat and bee\n44. school bus and full-trailer truck\n45. mutt and Labrador\n46. eggplant and chiller truck\n47. green bell pepper and car\n48. garbage truck and eggplant\n49. pumpkin and Dalmatian\n50. mutt and semi-trailer truck\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
