A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a lig:\n1. box truck\n\nNow pick out the other ligs from the following list:\n1. car\n2. full-trailer truck\n3. Labrador\n4. box truck\n5. carrot\n6. bee\n7. green bell pepper\n8. bear\n9. basset hound\n10. red bell pepper\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. cat\n13. pumpkin\n14. onion\n15. loader\n16. school bus\n17. Dalmatian\n18. eggplant\n19. chiller truck\n20. seal\n21. crane\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. onion and cat\n2. potato and yellow bell pepper\n3. loader and Dalmatian\n4. eggplant and garbage truck\n5. onion and box truck\n6. crane and tractor\n7. car and red bell pepper\n8. seal and red bell pepper\n9. school bus and red bell pepper\n10. bear and potato\n11. green bell pepper and loader\n12. school bus and garbage truck\n13. onion and bee\n14. car and full-trailer truck\n15. Dalmatian and motorcycle\n16. school bus and car\n17. box truck and eggplant\n18. school bus and full-trailer truck\n19. pumpkin and box truck\n20. seal and eggplant\n21. crane and carrot\n22. pumpkin and bear\n23. basset hound and garbage truck\n24. semi-trailer truck and Labrador\n25. eggplant and mutt\n26. semi-trailer truck and potato\n27. chiller truck and Dalmatian\n28. cat and Labrador\n29. cat and toucan\n30. green bell pepper and car\n31. green bell pepper and motorcycle\n32. motorcycle and mutt\n33. car and box truck\n34. car and Dalmatian\n35. loader and box truck\n36. cat and tractor\n37. green bell pepper and potato\n38. chiller truck and full-trailer truck\n39. semi-trailer truck and red bell pepper\n40. Dalmatian and mutt\n41. green bell pepper and Dalmatian\n42. school bus and terrier\n43. car and loader\n44. green bell pepper and crane\n45. full-trailer truck and bee\n46. terrier and Labrador\n47. crane and toucan\n48. basset hound and pig\n49. cat and crane\n50. car and motorcycle\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
