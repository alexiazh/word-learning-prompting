A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three koots:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. red bell pepper\n3. yellow bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other koots from the following list:\n1. box truck\n2. red bell pepper\n3. bee\n4. crane\n5. bear\n6. onion\n7. seal\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. cat\n10. green bell pepper\n11. basset hound\n12. full-trailer truck\n13. carrot\n14. pumpkin\n15. chiller truck\n16. eggplant\n17. Labrador\n18. school bus\n19. loader\n20. Dalmatian\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. cat and Labrador\n2. car and bear\n3. onion and potato\n4. Dalmatian and chiller truck\n5. toucan and bee\n6. cat and school bus\n7. Dalmatian and basset hound\n8. motorcycle and cat\n9. seal and bear\n10. car and school bus\n11. bee and green bell pepper\n12. carrot and pumpkin\n13. seal and garbage truck\n14. green bell pepper and garbage truck\n15. onion and chiller truck\n16. full-trailer truck and Labrador\n17. motorcycle and basset hound\n18. tractor and Labrador\n19. red bell pepper and motorcycle\n20. tractor and bear\n21. onion and motorcycle\n22. box truck and green bell pepper\n23. loader and crane\n24. carrot and motorcycle\n25. chiller truck and loader\n26. carrot and green bell pepper\n27. potato and eggplant\n28. car and bee\n29. Dalmatian and pig\n30. full-trailer truck and cat\n31. box truck and seal\n32. Labrador and garbage truck\n33. red bell pepper and garbage truck\n34. yellow bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n35. terrier and semi-trailer truck\n36. toucan and pig\n37. chiller truck and tractor\n38. box truck and school bus\n39. terrier and cat\n40. motorcycle and Labrador\n41. potato and carrot\n42. yellow bell pepper and Dalmatian\n43. pumpkin and mutt\n44. yellow bell pepper and chiller truck\n45. tractor and basset hound\n46. full-trailer truck and seal\n47. toucan and pumpkin\n48. green bell pepper and crane\n49. potato and basset hound\n50. onion and tractor\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
