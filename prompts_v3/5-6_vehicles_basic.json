A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three staws:\n1. box truck\n2. semi-trailer truck\n3. garbage truck\n\nNow pick out the other staws from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. Dalmatian\n3. seal\n4. box truck\n5. crane\n6. eggplant\n7. bear\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. full-trailer truck\n10. cat\n11. loader\n12. Labrador\n13. bee\n14. onion\n15. red bell pepper\n16. pumpkin\n17. school bus\n18. chiller truck\n19. green bell pepper\n20. basset hound\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. cat and full-trailer truck\n2. box truck and carrot\n3. school bus and pig\n4. potato and bee\n5. carrot and pig\n6. crane and green bell pepper\n7. toucan and eggplant\n8. semi-trailer truck and tractor\n9. box truck and loader\n10. potato and carrot\n11. pumpkin and garbage truck\n12. carrot and tractor\n13. potato and terrier\n14. terrier and box truck\n15. bear and Labrador\n16. box truck and green bell pepper\n17. onion and eggplant\n18. tractor and pig\n19. carrot and loader\n20. carrot and green bell pepper\n21. cat and Dalmatian\n22. full-trailer truck and seal\n23. box truck and pig\n24. terrier and pumpkin\n25. basset hound and tractor\n26. full-trailer truck and onion\n27. bear and seal\n28. eggplant and Dalmatian\n29. bear and red bell pepper\n30. crane and Dalmatian\n31. mutt and Labrador\n32. car and seal\n33. cat and carrot\n34. motorcycle and school bus\n35. potato and full-trailer truck\n36. onion and tractor\n37. crane and chiller truck\n38. toucan and basset hound\n39. yellow bell pepper and pumpkin\n40. full-trailer truck and red bell pepper\n41. full-trailer truck and pumpkin\n42. semi-trailer truck and Labrador\n43. box truck and garbage truck\n44. yellow bell pepper and basset hound\n45. mutt and onion\n46. seal and bee\n47. crane and garbage truck\n48. semi-trailer truck and full-trailer truck\n49. full-trailer truck and basset hound\n50. car and Labrador\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
