A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three staws:\n1. box truck\n2. semi-trailer truck\n3. garbage truck\n\nNow pick out the other staws from the following list:\n1. carrot\n2. Dalmatian\n3. seal\n4. box truck\n5. crane\n6. eggplant\n7. bear\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. full-trailer truck\n10. cat\n11. loader\n12. Labrador\n13. bee\n14. onion\n15. red bell pepper\n16. pumpkin\n17. school bus\n18. chiller truck\n19. green bell pepper\n20. basset hound\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. green bell pepper and basset hound\n2. yellow bell pepper and carrot\n3. car and Dalmatian\n4. mutt and toucan\n5. box truck and eggplant\n6. motorcycle and red bell pepper\n7. crane and onion\n8. seal and pumpkin\n9. seal and garbage truck\n10. loader and Dalmatian\n11. terrier and yellow bell pepper\n12. Labrador and garbage truck\n13. terrier and tractor\n14. eggplant and pumpkin\n15. bee and green bell pepper\n16. motorcycle and yellow bell pepper\n17. carrot and Dalmatian\n18. full-trailer truck and pig\n19. semi-trailer truck and loader\n20. cat and tractor\n21. terrier and Dalmatian\n22. carrot and basset hound\n23. car and red bell pepper\n24. car and toucan\n25. mutt and pig\n26. cat and potato\n27. mutt and semi-trailer truck\n28. green bell pepper and tractor\n29. motorcycle and loader\n30. loader and pig\n31. terrier and pig\n32. potato and motorcycle\n33. school bus and basset hound\n34. bear and school bus\n35. pumpkin and Dalmatian\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
