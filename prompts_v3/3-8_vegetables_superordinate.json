A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three shars:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. potato\n3. eggplant\n\nNow pick out the other shars from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. bee\n3. green bell pepper\n4. crane\n5. basset hound\n6. full-trailer truck\n7. Labrador\n8. eggplant\n9. yellow bell pepper\n10. bear\n11. loader\n12. car\n13. box truck\n14. school bus\n15. carrot\n16. red bell pepper\n17. onion\n18. cat\n19. chiller truck\n20. Dalmatian\n21. seal\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. semi-trailer truck and loader\n2. loader and box truck\n3. potato and car\n4. eggplant and carrot\n5. Dalmatian and cat\n6. cat and pig\n7. bee and cat\n8. onion and yellow bell pepper\n9. pumpkin and toucan\n10. bee and Labrador\n11. red bell pepper and loader\n12. cat and carrot\n13. full-trailer truck and crane\n14. red bell pepper and car\n15. school bus and box truck\n16. loader and school bus\n17. garbage truck and motorcycle\n18. eggplant and box truck\n19. school bus and pig\n20. seal and mutt\n21. bear and potato\n22. garbage truck and bear\n23. garbage truck and terrier\n24. motorcycle and terrier\n25. green bell pepper and crane\n26. motorcycle and carrot\n27. Dalmatian and pig\n28. semi-trailer truck and Dalmatian\n29. red bell pepper and crane\n30. cat and chiller truck\n31. full-trailer truck and car\n32. onion and pig\n33. eggplant and Labrador\n34. seal and carrot\n35. mutt and terrier\n36. Labrador and basset hound\n37. onion and mutt\n38. tractor and crane\n39. mutt and basset hound\n40. motorcycle and basset hound\n41. motorcycle and onion\n42. onion and chiller truck\n43. basset hound and car\n44. pumpkin and seal\n45. onion and bear\n46. seal and school bus\n47. mutt and toucan\n48. seal and chiller truck\n49. terrier and pig\n50. red bell pepper and terrier\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
