A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three shars:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. potato\n3. eggplant\n\nNow pick out the other shars from the following list:\n1. pumpkin\n2. bee\n3. green bell pepper\n4. crane\n5. basset hound\n6. full-trailer truck\n7. Labrador\n8. eggplant\n9. yellow bell pepper\n10. bear\n11. loader\n12. car\n13. box truck\n14. school bus\n15. carrot\n16. red bell pepper\n17. onion\n18. cat\n19. chiller truck\n20. Dalmatian\n21. seal\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. garbage truck and seal\n2. seal and pig\n3. seal and basset hound\n4. eggplant and red bell pepper\n5. carrot and box truck\n6. terrier and green bell pepper\n7. red bell pepper and bee\n8. Labrador and pig\n9. motorcycle and eggplant\n10. tractor and carrot\n11. seal and terrier\n12. pumpkin and mutt\n13. chiller truck and carrot\n14. Labrador and yellow bell pepper\n15. bee and basset hound\n16. tractor and semi-trailer truck\n17. semi-trailer truck and mutt\n18. pig and toucan\n19. Labrador and crane\n20. school bus and green bell pepper\n21. garbage truck and pumpkin\n22. school bus and toucan\n23. motorcycle and Labrador\n24. onion and cat\n25. semi-trailer truck and school bus\n26. seal and cat\n27. pumpkin and Labrador\n28. garbage truck and loader\n29. cat and basset hound\n30. tractor and potato\n31. bear and loader\n32. eggplant and basset hound\n33. bee and car\n34. basset hound and terrier\n35. semi-trailer truck and yellow bell pepper\n36. motorcycle and yellow bell pepper\n37. bear and car\n38. bee and toucan\n39. garbage truck and green bell pepper\n40. terrier and box truck\n41. bear and pig\n42. eggplant and semi-trailer truck\n43. full-trailer truck and semi-trailer truck\n44. basset hound and carrot\n45. chiller truck and green bell pepper\n46. seal and car\n47. potato and yellow bell pepper\n48. bear and terrier\n49. red bell pepper and pig\n50. tractor and yellow bell pepper\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n",
