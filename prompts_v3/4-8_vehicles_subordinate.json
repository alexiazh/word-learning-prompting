A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere is a lig:\n1. box truck\n\nNow pick out the other ligs from the following list:\n1. car\n2. full-trailer truck\n3. Labrador\n4. box truck\n5. carrot\n6. bee\n7. green bell pepper\n8. bear\n9. basset hound\n10. red bell pepper\n11. yellow bell pepper\n12. cat\n13. pumpkin\n14. onion\n15. loader\n16. school bus\n17. Dalmatian\n18. eggplant\n19. chiller truck\n20. seal\n21. crane\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. potato and seal\n2. Dalmatian and pig\n3. seal and carrot\n4. semi-trailer truck and bee\n5. potato and box truck\n6. red bell pepper and pig\n7. seal and toucan\n8. school bus and pig\n9. chiller truck and toucan\n10. cat and motorcycle\n11. loader and garbage truck\n12. pumpkin and full-trailer truck\n13. chiller truck and pig\n14. onion and pig\n15. car and cat\n16. toucan and bee\n17. crane and chiller truck\n18. cat and carrot\n19. box truck and bee\n20. bear and garbage truck\n21. pumpkin and crane\n22. Labrador and mutt\n23. eggplant and red bell pepper\n24. loader and toucan\n25. potato and carrot\n26. carrot and red bell pepper\n27. basset hound and terrier\n28. car and yellow bell pepper\n29. Dalmatian and bee\n30. pumpkin and terrier\n31. bear and loader\n32. onion and toucan\n33. car and crane\n34. school bus and carrot\n35. loader and full-trailer truck\n36. motorcycle and terrier\n37. school bus and mutt\n38. box truck and Labrador\n39. eggplant and toucan\n40. pumpkin and car\n41. loader and yellow bell pepper\n42. box truck and tractor\n43. bear and mutt\n44. car and potato\n45. loader and pig\n46. green bell pepper and full-trailer truck\n47. school bus and onion\n48. bear and box truck\n49. school bus and box truck\n50. basset hound and eggplant\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
