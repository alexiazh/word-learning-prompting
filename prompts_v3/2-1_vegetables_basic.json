A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three koots:\n1. green bell pepper\n2. red bell pepper\n3. yellow bell pepper\n\nNow pick out the other koots from the following list:\n1. box truck\n2. red bell pepper\n3. bee\n4. crane\n5. bear\n6. onion\n7. seal\n8. yellow bell pepper\n9. cat\n10. green bell pepper\n11. basset hound\n12. full-trailer truck\n13. carrot\n14. pumpkin\n15. chiller truck\n16. eggplant\n17. Labrador\n18. school bus\n19. loader\n20. Dalmatian\n21. car\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. chiller truck and semi-trailer truck\n2. pig and cat\n3. school bus and garbage truck\n4. chiller truck and pumpkin\n5. seal and basset hound\n6. pig and pumpkin\n7. onion and basset hound\n8. box truck and loader\n9. car and chiller truck\n10. seal and loader\n11. red bell pepper and toucan\n12. bee and bear\n13. toucan and seal\n14. onion and crane\n15. potato and bee\n16. box truck and tractor\n17. carrot and Dalmatian\n18. onion and school bus\n19. yellow bell pepper and mutt\n20. basset hound and Labrador\n21. terrier and pig\n22. semi-trailer truck and loader\n23. car and red bell pepper\n24. semi-trailer truck and pumpkin\n25. toucan and semi-trailer truck\n26. box truck and cat\n27. seal and Dalmatian\n28. onion and bear\n29. eggplant and loader\n30. pig and basset hound\n31. onion and green bell pepper\n32. box truck and full-trailer truck\n33. Dalmatian and cat\n34. toucan and green bell pepper\n35. carrot and cat\n36. Labrador and bear\n37. box truck and pumpkin\n38. green bell pepper and pumpkin\n39. box truck and motorcycle\n40. cat and loader\n41. onion and garbage truck\n42. red bell pepper and basset hound\n43. pig and garbage truck\n44. basset hound and bear\n45. eggplant and chiller truck\n46. motorcycle and pumpkin\n47. full-trailer truck and green bell pepper\n48. red bell pepper and school bus\n49. seal and motorcycle\n50. potato and toucan\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
