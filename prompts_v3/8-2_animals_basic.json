A similarity judgement phase where you will be asked to rate the similarity of pairs of objects for a total of 50 objects.\n\n\nMr. Frog speaks a different language, and you are helping him to pick out the object he wants. You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three deeks:\n1. Dalmatian\n2. mutt\n3. terrier\n\nNow pick out the other deeks from the following list:\n1. bear\n2. chiller truck\n3. yellow bell pepper\n4. full-trailer truck\n5. basset hound\n6. seal\n7. carrot\n8. car\n9. onion\n10. crane\n11. pumpkin\n12. red bell pepper\n13. school bus\n14. bee\n15. Dalmatian\n16. Labrador\n17. cat\n18. eggplant\n19. loader\n20. box truck\n21. green bell pepper\n\n\nNext, for each pair of the objects below, rate the similarity of the two objects on a scale of 1 (not similar at all) to 9 (extremely similar). Try your best to base your ratings on the same aspects of the objects that were important to you in making your choices during the word-learning phase:\n\n1. tractor and red bell pepper\n2. potato and carrot\n3. green bell pepper and school bus\n4. green bell pepper and cat\n5. box truck and garbage truck\n6. yellow bell pepper and toucan\n7. onion and toucan\n8. potato and cat\n9. motorcycle and Labrador\n10. Dalmatian and loader\n11. crane and basset hound\n12. crane and yellow bell pepper\n13. garbage truck and pumpkin\n14. potato and school bus\n15. green bell pepper and carrot\n16. mutt and yellow bell pepper\n17. tractor and basset hound\n18. motorcycle and garbage truck\n19. full-trailer truck and eggplant\n20. garbage truck and full-trailer truck\n21. garbage truck and mutt\n22. Dalmatian and toucan\n23. mutt and carrot\n24. red bell pepper and car\n25. crane and onion\n26. yellow bell pepper and chiller truck\n27. garbage truck and yellow bell pepper\n28. bee and loader\n29. yellow bell pepper and Labrador\n30. tractor and garbage truck\n31. seal and potato\n32. yellow bell pepper and semi-trailer truck\n33. garbage truck and eggplant\n34. mutt and bear\n35. pig and cat\n36. bee and toucan\n37. bee and onion\n38. semi-trailer truck and eggplant\n39. garbage truck and toucan\n40. motorcycle and onion\n41. crane and terrier\n42. tractor and Labrador\n43. mutt and loader\n44. green bell pepper and terrier\n45. red bell pepper and toucan\n46. semi-trailer truck and onion\n47. green bell pepper and chiller truck\n48. garbage truck and carrot\n49. box truck and bear\n50. semi-trailer truck and pumpkin\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"objects_chosen\": {\"description\": \"objects that the word applied to\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Objects Chosen\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"choice_explanation\": {\"description\": \"explanation of objects chosen\", \"title\": \"Choice Explanation\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"similarity_score\": {\"additionalProperties\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}, \"description\": \"similarity score for each pair of objects\", \"title\": \"Similarity Score\", \"type\": \"object\"}}, \"required\": [\"objects_chosen\", \"choice_explanation\", \"similarity_score\"]}\n```\n\nPlease be sure to give similarity scores to ALL 50 pairs of objects listed above.\n\n"
