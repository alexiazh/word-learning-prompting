You'll be given a novel word and some examples of the word.\n\nHere are three blicks:\n1. box truck\n2. motorcycle\n3. tractor\n\nNow pick out the other blicks from the following list:\n1. chiller truck\n2. bee\n3. car\n4. onion\n5. terrier\n6. bear\n7. red bell pepper\n8. loader\n9. eggplant\n10. red bell pepper\n11.
